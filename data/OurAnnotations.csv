m9moe9,gro8e7p,It's my birthday today....,"I'm turning 19 and nobody seems to give a shit. I spend the whole day crying in an empty room. My ""friends"" went out drinking, all of them know about my birthday, they didn't even invite me. I never felt more alone, whole city is in lockdown so I can't even go to a fucking bar. I'm not sure what I did wrong. Am I so terrible? Boring ? Depressing to be around ? I did my best to make them happy when they were celebrating. Haven't made a friend in the last 10 years, it's not exactly easy for me. Sorry for complaining and all....just had to vent I guess.

Update: 
Thanks everybody for the birthday wishes. Unfortunately this might have been one of the worst days of my life and it isn't even over yet. Had a heated argument with my mom. She wants me to move on, apparently I don't appreciate her becouse obviously I don't feel like talking and I'm quite sad. I tried to explain that I need time right now. I just needed her to be there for me. We screamed at each other on the way home. Found out my father tried to cheat on her many years ago, not sure why she decided to bring it up now but it made me feel even worse. I guess we are different people and we deal with emotions differently. Still feels like I have nobody. Everything is closed becouse of corona and none of my friends messaged me. But your messages help a bit so thank you for that.","I am sorry to hear that and I hope you eventually find your people, who love and appreciate you, as you deserve. Happy birthday!",2,0,0

I’ve been so selfish. Focusing on myself, my ex boyfriend, things that don’t really matter... I feel an immense guilt that is indescribable. It’s so simple to call or stop by but I didn’t do it. I guess I just thought she was invincible or that I had more time. I thought she’d be there when I had my life together but she’s gone now and there’s nothing I can do to change it. I hope she knew that she was my everything and I always talked about her...","I'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you and your grandma had a great relationship.

lxnoc7,gujbyfx,I'm slowly developing a unwanted fear of women (Not a hate post),"Just gonna make this clear I don't hate women and In fact most of my friends are female and most know about this. A little about me im 18, a pretty passive, and quite guy who doesn't really like violence and loud noises. I grow up in a all female house(mom feel out of love for date like after I was born). Both my mom and sister a really aggressive. Younger sister loves to hit me for no reason and my used to beat me a good bit and sometimes she put a knife to my throat.

So for the last year cus of covid I've been inside I've been doing lots of things cus well I got the time for it.  So for a whole year I've been realizing that my past experiences and what I've seen on social media has pushed a fear of women onto me. 

Me and many of my friends have gotten their hearts broken but until them I never actually got to go into a relationship I've just kept getting used for something. Which has made it pretty hard to have a bound with anyone, not to mention I've become afraid of touching as I don't know what rumors could spread (I've been seeing some women laugh and mock guys for stupid stuff). 

So in the end I guess I'm afraid of heartbreak, getting used and getting accused of something I didn't do.

*My apologies if it's written bad*","I realized after a long time that my psychopathic mom (+ bullying, obsessive bodily shame, early social media, and anime to some extent) is the reason I used to fear women and developed a form of paranoia about them. It took me until the age of 25 to get over it and I had to become somewhat of an asshole, with a selfish asshole attitude, to do that. Even then, the PTSD was still in effect and I’d experience a highly elevated heart rate around any girl who seemed to be of higher social standing than me. It wasn’t until I was 27-28 that I really got over it and started living a normal life.",0,2,0
hkv1if,fwxgfpi,It all feels like a waste,"Around Christmas time last year I hit a mental funk and it's been something that has stuck with me ever since and as of the past few weeks has only gotten worse. 

This mental health shit started this all off was me coming to the realization that in the 10 or so years I've been on the dating scene I have nothing good to show for it. Tried both connecting with women in my everyday life (which has led to nothing but hurt for me) and online dating, which I've come to the realization is literally the worst method in trying to find romance. 

Then the pandemic hit and school went to all online and now I've graduated and something else has made my mental state so much worse. I realized that in all my time at university I didn't make one single friend. It never occurred to me because I did get some interaction with people during school, but now that I have gone literally months without talking to a single person outside of my parents its become noticeable. I've never felt more isolated and alone in my entire life and it hurts. 

I don't know what to do anymore, outside of earning my degree (which in and of itself presented me more than its fair share of problems), I feel like the past 8 or so years of my life has been an utter waste. No friends, no romantic partner, no job (it's great getting ghosted by an employer after 4 interviews) and for the immediate future I see no way to rectify this. Due to both being in a pandemic and me living in the middle of fucking nowhere. 

Well that is the end of my rant and if you made it through it thank you, I don't expect anything from you this was just a way for me to vent.","Hey, sorry you're not feeling great these days. Sounds like winter's depressive blues haven't left with the arrival of warmer weather, and that really sucks. 

A lot of people have different college experiences. Some make tons of friends, some don't. Some study furiously, some skip classes to play video games. Some get shit faced at every opportunity, some never drink. Just because your experience seems atypical in retrospect doesn't mean it was wasted time; we all do things at our own pace and following our own priorities.

It sounds like you didn't make a lot of connections with others, which is okay. Lots of people end up doing that, for one reason or another. Now that you're looking back with regret try to find out why you weren't as successful in that regard as you want to be. Did you not care about others? Did it not seem important? What's changed? Do you have different feeling or priorities now?

Now that you're pretty much out of school your best bet for making friends is probably either from work or from hobbies. If you're passionate about something look into it. Take those classes in karate or improv you've been putting off, and get to know the people who are also there. You'll already have something in common, so initial conversations are easy. Once you get to know people better you can begin being friends.

It's a lot easier to make excuses for our shortcomings than it is to accept them and try to change them. If you're really serious about making friends, read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. It's a classic, there's a PDF somewhere, it's great at explaining what people want from social interactions and how to better accommodate them. It changed my life.

lcga1l,glzw144,My favorite uncle has cancer,My favorite uncle got diagnosed with cancer 2 days ago. And he just had surgery for it today. Thankfully its colon cancer which has a very high survival rate. He still has 6 rounds of chemo to go and should be out of the ICU in a couple of days. So he should be fine. But this is still the same type of cancer that killed my grandma because it wasn't detected early enough and spread to the liver. Now I am just wondering what if my dad and other uncles and aunts have it too but just dont know it yet? My dad is very lazy and of dismissive about his health and worries about the costs of things too much. I need him to go get checked for cancer asap.,"Honestly, i don't really know what would i do in your situation.

l7ym30,gl9kxav,Don't know what I'm doing,"I was bullied for almost 7 years while I was on mid and high school, at least on my country (Chile) we have always along the whole school the same classmates so they were the ones who bullied me all of that time.

I have 21 almost 22 and yet I'm alone, never had a girlfriend, never kiss someone (I'm straight). The thing is that I finally started to feel way better this last year (the second half to be specific) even tho I still hadn't a single friend to talk to. I started to feel really good about myself and started to see ways to meet new people, to be honest that is really hard since the pandemic and also because in my city was on lockdown since march and just got more ""freedom"" since September more or less. I'm a college student and lately I'm receiving and doing awesome things for my future and my career but actually I'm feeling really afraid. I can't understand how I can be starting to be really successful this early on my career but I still fail and totally sucked at social relationships, how can I bee sure that everything that I'm working won't fail like my social life.

mtbjpq,guz9h60,At some point it stops being teenage angst and starts being a quarter/mid life crisis.,"I'm having a difficult time with... I guess living?
I'm not diagnosed with depression, or anxiety, or anything. I tried therapy for a short while, but stopped because of the pandemic. I'm a functioning adult with a rewarding job.
I just do not like my life at all.
I find I spend most of my time doing 'numbing' activities (mindless video games, drinking (not getting drunk), going for walks or drives, flipping through reddit/twitter, etc.). If something prevents me from numbing or pulls me out of my routine, I get really agitated and frustrated. I like to have a thing to do, and anything that leads to me just being bored... time to think just makes me really upset.
And more stimulating activities (exercise, reading academic stuff, etc) that wakes my brain up? I get a rush of joy, but then crash and get really frustrated or upset soon after. Like, I revel in feeling alive, but then I remember how pointless it all is.

I often find myself just sort of vibrating with frustration or displeasure. And it sometimes effects my work, I've definitely let projects pile up and just blamed the pandemic. But I know this has been going on much longer, just quieter.

The only good part of my days is the 20-30 minutes on the weekend when I can sit by myself and surf the internet without anyone knowing where I am or what I'm doing. It's my only moment of privacy or alone time. I use it to write myself letters. They range from depressive rants to uplifting mantras. Usually even the rants end naturally on a positive ""we can do this!"" note. I have really good self talk, oddly enough.

I used to have goals. Or I thought I did. Everything just feels really fake and distant. I look at old photos or posts and think ""who the fuck is that?"" I used to want to do creative things, or go on adventures. Now I just sort of wish I could finish reading a book without needing to move mountains.

I spent 90% of my days waiting for the next task, the next required action, the next crisis. I am sick of it and I don't know how to unpack how upset I am. I'm not even upset about a thing, just in general! And, the worst part is, I can't actually remember a time in my life when I didn't think like this. I was always teased as being ""angsty,"" even as a little kid. I don't think there was a time when I didn't picture life as something I need to endure, to put up with, a burden we all share against our wills. My existence feels like a hostage situation, like I'm trapped. And I know not everyone feels like this, but... how? Like, I can enjoy a sunset and still feel deeply miserable. How do people, just.... live?

**tl:dr;** *I am very unhappy despite my successes, and I don't remember ever being just plainly happy. How do I live in a way other than constantly trying to ignore/avoid thinking about how unhappy I am?*","You're the first person I've managed to relate so much to, shit.",0,2,0

oa26eb,h3gye2j,I don’t know where to start,"I’m sitting next to the pool at 1:30 am as my wife and children sleep.  I’m on the brink of a $2.5 million windfall from the sale of a 1/3 share in my S Corp (a very acrimonious split that eats at me everyday, the money has done nothing to ease the sting).  

I have it all I guess.  Ten years ago I was released from NY Skate prison after 8 years for armed robbery.  I worked my way to a modicum of success, battling alcohol addiction along the way.  Finally joined a 12 step program after a parole violation put me in Rikers Island for 8 months.

I’m coming up on three years sobriety, my wife and her father almost died from Covid but they pulled through and both are doing well today.  We’ve defied the odds and yet…

I’m sitting here watching the wind blow a solitary inflatable tube around an empty pool and I’m in tears.  It’s as if I’ve reached the summit and I’m just underwhelmed by the view.  This is what I scratched and clawed myself to?  This is it?

As the wind passes over my shoulder making ripples in the water I just see time slipping through my fingers.  I see the day my children are grown and moved away and I see myself swallowing regret at not cherishing every moment of their wondrous youth.  

It’s always time.  Where once I counted the days and weeks an months and years, finding new ways to make the time pass faster, now I reach out to grab it only for it turn to sand and wash away with the breeze.  And I’m left feeling empty.  

I feel alone.  I feel misunderstood, underestimated, overestimated, looked down upon, put on a pedestal by those who silently wish to see me fall.  

I’ve seen light in the darkest places, and darkness in the brightest days.  I’ve found peace in chaos and chaos in success.  I know I’m ranting I just don’t know how to express what’s happening inside me.  

I’ll wake up tomorrow, take the kids to daycare, get back to work on my new business and tackle all the incidentals along the way.  I’ll hug my kids when they come home, go to the park, get ice cream, listen to their laughter like it’s the greatest symphony ever written and I’ll be back here tomorrow night watching time slip away…","Sorry to hear you're dealing with this.

COVID has made me super lonely. I see my Mom and my bf. I do go to work, but they're all negative and there's rarely one nice thing said. I'm super lonely with COVID and now I'm alone all day. I do school online, I work a little bit a week, but otherwise it's just me. I throw myself into homework because it's a busy semester.

My friends are all too busy or only want to bother with me if they need something, so reaching out doesn't work. My family is too busy with work or too stressed to care.

I decided to pay it forward and donate $200 worth of groceries to feed over 50 families in a small town in the Philippines where my mom grew up. Now she’s annoyed at me because she said she wants me to save my money and focus on myself. I pitched in with my aunts (her sisters) who also work overseas to donate $$ and my mom, although she has money, did not participate in this family fundraiser. We gathered about $500 between us and it’s going to provide food for pretty much the entire community. My mom’s not happy that I was one of the “sponsors”. Part of me feels like she is a bit butthurt because her sisters reached out to her for help and she refused, meanwhile me, her daughter, volunteered to give something.  

It honestly feels incredibly good to be able to provide something even if it was just a small contribution. I never want to see any families starve. This part in the Philippines spend less than $50 a month to feed their families and my average grocery expense is at least $2-300 for me and my BF.

All of that happened while I was at work and I didn’t have the time to process any of it. Later that day, I helped my family with some emergency bills and was left for no money for food or groceries. Yesterday, I found out my mom has breast cancer. This is so much for 24 hrs and I can’t handle it. All I want is someone to hold me and just keep me company while I lay here in silence. All I feel is emptiness. I’m alone and by myself living on a college campus away from my family and finals and graduation are right around the corner. This couldn’t have came at a worse possible time. I’m jealous of the people who can wake up and have multiple people in their company. I have never enjoyed physical affection but I would kill right now for someone to even hand me a bottle of water.

i5c6jx,g0pvojl,Yesterday I got felt-up by one of my students,"Throwaway. And I don't give anyone permission to use my story.

Background: I'm new at a high school in the rural south-- husband and I just moved here before corona. I'm an athletic trainer so I prevent, treat, and rehab injuries for the school's sports teams. Yesterday was our first day back but I've been covering volunteer football workouts all summer so familiar with the team. The story I'm about to tell involved a kid from the upper level football team.

The kid is helping me on the sideline since it's not his practice. First weirdness happens when this kid basically runs at me for a hug as soon as we're out of eyesight of others. I had NO idea this was happening as we've been masking and social distancing, so I reminded him of the 6 foot rule and said no hugs. Fine.

After practice this kid is sitting on the floor inside and I need him out of the building so I can lock up and go home. I tell him it's time. He reaches his hand up for help to get off the floor and I grabbed it and pulled.

You guys. He tried to pull me ONTO HIM. Like, gave me a GOOD, STEADY PULL towards him so much so that I actually lost my balance for a second. I lift and I've been an athlete all my life so I'm strong-- I realize what he's doing, regain my balance and dig my heels in, and POWER CLEAN this kid off the ground. He realizes midway during this that I'm much stronger than he thought, because as soon as he felt me pulling he suddenly stands and pretends to fall forward into me, reaching and groping with his hands the whole way. I'm going to guess he weighs 260ish, so no way did I launch him into me.

About .04 seconds before he actually makes contact with my chest area, my brain kicks in and understands fully what's about to happen so I scream, ""WOAH! NO!!!"""" block him and push him away and walk outside where there are other people. 

I have to go back to lock my room and get my stuff so after a few ""fucking shit"" moments I go in, grab my stuff, tell the kid goodbye and run. He has a visibly angry look on his face and he doesn't say anything to me on the way out. I'm certain this is because he could sense that I knew what he was doing and was angry because he got caught. Good, F you kid.

But now I'm sad. This was literally my FIRST FULL DAY on the job. I absolutely cannot tell anyone. The kids Dad is involved in the program. This is SOUTHERN FOOTBALL and I will be held fully accountable for any harm that would come to the team as a result of any disciplinary action, IF there were to be any at all. You all know the story. And so this kid will get away with it.

It's been especially disheartening since learning about Daisy Coleman yesterday. To all the women who suffer through this shit on a regular basis- I see you. If no one else cares, I do. One day this shit has GOT to change.",He will only get away with it (and go on to do further damage to someone possibly not as physically able as you) if you ALLOW him to. At this moment. Now.,0,0,0
lztsj2,gq57rr7,"5 Lesser Known Facts About Our Brain, That Can Change Our Life!","&amp;#x200B;

1. **In the morning, after we wake up, our cortisol levels increase by 50%** (highest) for the first 30-60 mins. Cortisol is a stress hormone. That is why it is advised to mediate or do simple breathing exercise right after you are up, to normalise the cortisol levels.
2. **Neuro-plasticity**, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is **the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganisation.** These changes range from individual neurone pathways making new connections, to systematic adjustments like cortical remapping. **You can literally turn around your life with this hack alone!**
3. **Dream vs Reality:** Our **brain does not differentiate between dream and reality.** Thus, similar muscles respond to a particular activity either it is a dream or reality, that is why our brain goes to a partial paralysis state while we are asleep. **If you can dream it, you can make it your reality too.**
4. **Alpha Brain Waves:** Your **brain is a bustling hub of electrical activity.** This is due to the fact that the cells in your brain, called neurons, use electricity to communicate with each other. **Boosting your alpha waves might also increase your creativity levels.** In a study, researchers found evidence that they could trigger a surge in creativity if they specifically focused on enhancing alpha waves.
5. **Sleep &amp; Hippocampal Activation:** Having a good night sleep activates the Hippocampal part of our brain has reportedly shown to improve memory power, visualisation, virtual-navigation task, it also **improves memory consolidation, which is essential for improving long term memory.**

m3jvgs,gqrjxd8,I have sold my gaming lifestyle in hopes of a better future.,"I remember being proud of my $1000 pc build back in 2016. An i5 with a gtx 950, it was life for years until today. Gradually upgrading it until a 1060, I used every money I saved for my PC. The pandemic has made it harder for me to earn an income, especially in a 3rd world country/developing country. My family hasn't been able to earn as well, so as a last resort, I had to sold my only happiness, which was my computer in order to fill our stomachs for the next few months. Selling the parts was hard, I had to sold it at cheaper prices due to low ballers. Where people would sell gtx 1660s for $380, I sold my 1060 for a mere $100 because buyers were skeptic of 1060s being used for mining. I managed to sold every part, except my case and hard drive. At least I have an empty aluminum case that reminded me of my past gaming years. And I can still access my files if ever I were to buy a computer in the future once the pandemic normalizes.

g84olu,folozhx,After everything I'm finally done.,"I've cried non stop for 3 days now. I wake up crying. 

I was having a normal, even good, day at home with my partner during quarantine. When he came up to me and in all ways but saying it upfront, that he wanted to break up.

Saying bullshit like' ""I'll always love you"" ""I'll never forget you"" ""I still have that dream"" as hes breaking up with me. He wouldn't answer why, and kept avoiding responding. I left to go to my grandmothers. 

I gave up everything I owned and all my savings to be with this guy. I loved him and still do, with all my heart. Every second away from him hurts. Quarantine had been stressful because our roommates turned out to be really shitty people who bullied us, but primarily me. 95% of any argument or meltdowns we had were because of the flatmates. He knew it and I knew it.

We had a plan, lock down was finishing tomorrow. We had a plan. He was going to stay at a friends for a few weeks and I was going to stay with family for a few weeks, secure new jobs, then move in together again into our own place. No room mates. No drama, just us. 

Then I find out overhearing a call to WINZ that he plans to move into a flat without me then tries to say it was part of the plan the whole time, which it wasn't. I got upset, and treated like I was being unreasonable. It would have been fine if he talked to me about it but he didn't, just assumed I would be ok with it.

He promised my grandma and me when I was leaving we weren't broken up and the plan was still the same.

I've been sent away to a place I never wanted to be again. Hes ignoring me. And I just saw his post looking for a longterm flat and now hes living with some blonde whose prettier than I'll ever be.

Now I'm alone living next door to a guy who raped me not 5 months ago and who is somehow always outside the house when I go out. 

My dad disowned me 2 months ago and told me I'm not his biological kid. My mum's a narcissist and bully who tried to whore me out before I was 10. My grandma is hopeless.  


I am hurting so bad. This whole thing has turned into a severe series of intrusive thoughts.   


I always knew he was somewhat self centered. But it was tolerable.   


The last two weeks he hadn't wanted to touch me even for a hug, no kisses, no sex. He hardly even talked to me.  


I made dinner for him everynight, I cleaned our room when it was mostly his mess, washing, everything. Sex on demand. Would listen to him talk for hours about stuff I wasn't interested in because it made him happy. Spent hundreds on him.  


I tried to do everything a good partner should do and more.  


But it wasn't enough. As soon as the stress of a move came up he threw me aside. He would talk about wanting to be a man and independent and no responsibility. How alone he felt as I stood there and listened to all of it. He wanted me to go back to living at my grandmothers, next door to the man who raped me, for upwards of 8 months without seeing him because it was easier for him.  


I put up with him and our flatmates tag teaming to bully me for 4 weeks, to a point it lead to a accidental overdose on diazapam. Then he tried to throw me out over a genuine accident caused by stress. I still stuck it out for him.   


And then when he realizes I wasn't bullshitting about the flatmates being horrible to me, I'm meant to forgive him instantly. And I did.  


I love this guy so much, he means the world to me. And I don't know what to do. I'm hurting so badly. I've made half hearted attempts in the past but this is probably going to be it for me. I've never felt so broken and alone and used. I thought things were fine, that one day we would be married and have kids.   


I guess not.  


He messages me 3 days after, and says sorry for the bad communication, then goes back to ignoring me.

jazzo8,g8si6sj,I thought I wanted a touch or affection but it made me feel emptier.,"I've been feeling lonely for years ever since middle school started and throughout high school watching other people having fun with each other, sharing stuff together, laughing, supporting and stuff made me feel much lonelier. I kinda wanted what they have, the connection, the touch, the affection people have with each other.
Not saying that I didn't have that with my family at least not really, used to have a father who's been closest person I've ever been with.

Today having one of my classmates pat me on the back after having some small talk with him sorta made me feel sadder and emptier. I thought that I kinda wanted this.

n2hlwd,gwkihdr,Two losses too terrible to be true...,"This post took me 2 days to write. 
Warning: it's a long one. I don't really expect anyone to read it but what I just went through and how quickly my world turned upside down is truly unreal... unbelievable... and terribly tragic... and I have to get this out...

It has been 16 days since my husband and partner of 7+ years died. It has been 7 months and 16 days since my best friend of 12+ years died. 
Just typing that out hits hard with the realization of the timing with exactly 7 months between 2 of the closest people in my life. I am traumatized and in the deepest tunnel of extremely complicated grief. I'm lost, broken, and scared. And all of this over shadowing this pandemic, which has effected everyone to some extent. I'm not even 30 yet and I feel I've lived a life of 100 years. 8 months ago my world really consisted of 4 people I considered near, dear, and close in my heart. My older sister I'll call H, who knows me longest and best. 
My husband, I'll call him D, who was a part of every day of my life for the last 7+ years and the love of my life.
My best friend of 12+ years, I'll refer to as T, who had been a big part of my life and in my life since our junior year of high school.
My other best friend of 9+ years, I'll refer to as J, who also is a big part of my life.
September 18th, 2020: I am finishing up a shift at work when I get a text from J saying ""you need to call me."" I call him as I get in my car leaving work and as I'm pulling out of the parking spot he tells me to park. I do. He then sobs and tells me that T is dead. J found T dead in his apartment he had just moved in to. In his hand, a gun was held, and in his mouth was the fatal wound. He was broken and traumatized. We all kept a close friend group and T's death was a huge blow to us all. But J had the hardest hit with how he found T cold and lifeless on the couch... then make the call to 911 and more calls to T's family members and friends...
After comparing notes with other friends in T's circle we believe that T shot himself 3 days before J found him. Officially on his autopsy report his death is ruled ""accident"" and on his grave marker they put September 18th as date of death. But he was dead days before being found... he lived alone. I never knew him to be suicidal. He was the kinda guy that loved getting reactions out of people and would push the line or even dance along the edge of danger if it meant he got a giggle out of it. But I had also distanced myself in our friendship because of D. D would tell you he loved T and T was a great guy but a point was reached about 4 years ago when I didnt feel like I could hang out with T without there being a problem with D. The two even physically fought a couple of times. So I chose to stop hanging out with T around D and that meant feeling like I was sneaking around D's back just to see me best friend, or being hesitant to tell D when I was going to hang with T. To this day I still feel like if I hadn't have distanced like I did and was in T's life as much as I was before, then he might still be alive...
His death hit me hard and I was in a living, waking nightmare for at least 2 months. Work was hell because I didnt want to act like I cared what my clients had to say, all I wanted was to stay at home and shake my head in disbelief and stare at the wall in mourning. What made this harder was my husband. He was always a ""stay strong"" kinda man, and I am a ""stay strong"" kinda woman. But when T died, 3 days after finding out he died D tells me I'm going to have to get past his death eventually. The funeral hadn't even happened and he was telling me to cheer up and move on. He worsened the situation by telling J and me that we were bad friends to T because we weren't pushing the police to investigate T's death as a possible homicide, when J saw T first hand and knew beyond a doubt that there wasn't foul play so there wasn't a reason to push for any investigation. But D kept saying we were bad friends and it cut deeper every time. I asked for an apology days, even weeks, afterwards. But D refused to apologize... and that's when our own issues really started.
I had never experienced a loss that close to my heart. My mother even said that T's death left a big hole in my heart, and she was right. I never got to fully grieve my longest best friend because the longer I was sad, the more D pushed me to buck up and move on. He was never a good comforter but this death really made me see that and it made everything so so much harder... I eventually started acting like I was ""over it"" and stopped talking about T around D. Even packed away some things that I'd had of T's so D would think I was ""better."" Last time D said something about my grief was about 2 months when he asked ""how long can you grieve for T?"" 
Before going on, I need to give a little history on D's medical issues that led to his death. Three years ago, on April 15th, 2018, I had to get a neighbor to help me half support and half drag D to my car to get him to a hospital. He had spent 3 days throwing up blood, passing out and unable to walk due to weakness yet he refused to go to the hospital. When I finally got him to the hospital he was severely dehydrated and had severe blood loss. They had to give him something like 5 bags of blood to get him stabilized. We spent 3 days and 3 nights in the hospital. I slept by his bed every night. He didn't want me to tell anyone he was in the hospital. He was always the kind of man that liked to keep his personal business to himself. I respected his wishes at that time and only told my sister and J because that was too much for me to deal with on my own but I couldnt tell anyone else without D feeling betrayed. That hospital stay was when I learned he had cirrhosis of the liver. They had to band the blood vessels in his stomach that was causing him to throw up blood. On April 18th, 2018, he was able to get up and walk by himself so he insisted in being discharged, even though the hospital wanted him to stay at least one more night. He also refused to go to any follow ups. He didn't have insurance so he didn't want to rack up the bill any higher than it already was.
Yes, he was an alcoholic, and proud of it, so it seems. He drank every day. Some days he might drink a couple 24 oz beers, usually pay days he would buy liquor, but he was a daily drinker. I had my runs with him, trying to act hardcore and keep up with his alcohol consumption but the headaches and nausea from all that drinking caused me to back off and slow down. There were a couple nights where I embarrassed myself at his friend's house after drinking too much. So I would drink maybe 2-4 nights a week, depending on how the week went. But, the whole time I knew him, the longest I'd seen him go without alcohol was while he was in the hospital for drinking his liver to dysfunction. But that didn't stop him. In fact, he knew he had a bad liver for around 7-8 years, from what I've gathered. 
But through it all I still I loved him to my core and cared for him with all my heart. We were making plans to buy a house then I was going to get a new job with the degree I recently accomplished and we were about to level up our lives... or so I thought... But then his life took a nose dive downhill fast, and ended in a fatal crash.... he quit his job, his car broke, he couldn't afford to get his children and fell into a deep depression. He told me about his suicidal thoughts and he was scaring me with how he was acting... then he was yelling more, we were arguing more, H &amp; J were both ready to help me pack his stuff and kick him out and I was right at the point of wanting to tell him to pack his stuff but I couldnt leave without trying one last time to talk with him and work on making things better. We talked, but I never felt at peace with the situation, and in my mind I put our relationship on a ""wait and see if he heard and applied"" kinda hold.
April 11th, 2021: Once again, I'm at work when I see a missed call from D around 3 PM. He called to warn me that there was blood on the floor. I cursed because I immediately knew what that meant and I couldn't go through the hospital stay again, not by myself. It took 22 hours of him puking blood and me begging him to let me call an ambulance before his brain started to quit understanding everything and he could hardly form a response to anything. By the time the ambulance got here he couldn't even give them his social security number, by the time I met them at the ER he was unable to speak for himself with the doctors and I had to speak for him, before he was placed in an ICU room he spoke his last word to me which was ""yes"" when I had to try and get him to say whether his back hurt (no response, just moans of pain) or his stomach hurt to which he responded between moans ""yes."" There was no way to even imagine that would be the last word he spoke to me... by the next morning he was on life support, a ventilator, blood and plasma transfusions, and in an induced acoma. They said his cirrhosis of the liver caused sepsis which flooded his system with toxins and ammonia, damaged a kidney, resulting in internal bleeding in his stomach and every thing else that was going on. By day 3 the doctors seemed less grim and more determined to get him well again. Everyone started to hope... then Thursday comes... Thursday morning his alcohol withdrawls hit his system and the hospital had upped his oxygen and other made adjustments to medication to counteract the withdrawls. At 11 am the doctors told me and his brother that they were going to focus on getting him started on dialysis and working against the withdrawls. By 12 pm, D's mother arrives for the day. By 1 pm, nurses and doctors start running in the halls and the alarm goes off and before the room number for the code blue was announced I already knew it was him... his room... he was code blue...I was pulled past his room as I see them doing chest compressions... I hear them bring him back for maybe 10 seconds before he's gone again... they sit me in the room next to his with his mother and brother... we listen, hoping, I'm crying and shaking repeating ""no no no no no no no"" over and over again, in near hysterics... then the doctor comes in.... by 1:30 pm, April 15th, 2021, the doctor tells us they tried reviving him for 30 minutes, he's not coming back, he's dead... by April 18th he was buried.... by the 21st I was moved into a new apartment... I am devastated, traumatized, and broken. All the negativity in our relationship leading up to his death has made this loss that much worse. And I learned that his recent change in behavior could very well have been due to how sick he was...

I guess my question for you guys without any context, when do you guys decide to switch to a new therapist/give up on one? When do you make that decision?

\-------------

After being at this local CBT practice with an LCSW for 2 years and not making any progress I started in December with the head of the practice, a PhD psychologist. He's a fair bit older, reminds me of  Patton Oswalt in demeanor but less funny. 

We're in for 4 months now and it's all been telehealth as the practice is still socially distanced. My situation over the last 2 years, on top of anxiety/depression, has been an obsessive focus on tapering off my ssri, and eventually getting off the stimulant, but I've taken a crazy slow amount of time to do so.  I stopped the taper when covid started, and restarted the taper back in December. I'm \*almost\* done and it's been continually hell. Anyway in this distracted context, I feel like the ""therapy"" hasn't been sticking for years now. The med withdrawal probably augments my lack of progress.

Reflecting on it now, I haven't really been putting in enough of the work I suppose. I engage in conversation, but everything is still emotionally flat- the meds. I feel like the meds have also been messing with my memory and I've been blaming that. I can't tell if the people at this practice are not very effective at what they do, or if I'm the problem. 

This new guy was praised as the godfather of CBT by my previous guy, but he's been extremely underwhelming, and feels kind of phony. As far as I can tell we haven't gotten any CBT in, and the few bits and pieces have gone in one ear and out the other. He spends a lot of time talking about himself which can be frustrating, often in context of an example trying to lead to a point, but then it deteriorates into a tangent of whining about this and that. 

The age difference is a thing for sure, I'm also pretty sure he's on the opposite side of the political spectrum as myself. Not a huge deal but it's apparent when he goes into his whining tangents. 

This whole telehealth thing is frustrating as well, it might be just another reason this doesn't seem effective whatsoever.","If you feel the chemestry does't work, then it doesn't work. The only other thing you can do is to talk to your therapist with your issues about the therapie. Also if CBT didn't help you so far, you may be better suited for a different approach. CBT never agreed with me and actually made my social anxiety at times way worse.

Is this also weird? I've worked a lot to earn money both for university and finally for the switch I've wanted since it came out.

m471z8,gqtyx6b,My dad who got COVID and had A LOT of underlying health conditions survived and was released from hospital today!,"Almost 3 weeks ago my dad wasn’t feeling the greatest (chills and feeling weak). Quick background, since 1999 he’s had a quintuple bypass, CA in the stomach, has diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Since April of last year he’s been admitted/gone to the hospital 4 times as recently his lungs have been filling up with excess fluid causing him extreme difficulty to breath. Late last year we had him see a naturopathic doc where we completely changed his diet (he was having severe gout).

Leading up to a few weeks ago he was doing great, eating fruits, vegetables and healthy protein that wouldn’t flare up his gout and he was actually able to reduce the amount of insulin and how much blood pressure meds he was taking! So when he had mentioned to my mom (whose a nurse) that he had some chills and felt off, she knew right away to take him to the ER. And after running the test confirmed he had COVID. We found out later that our family friend living in my parents basement was positive too and he had passed it on to my dad (family friend works cleaning police HQs in the city, my dad hasn’t worked in years and has just been at home).

We feared the worst knowing EVERYTHING he has going for him and for the first few days in hospital it was touch and go praying and hoping he would not be intubated. Thankfully he wasn’t and because my mom is a nurse and knows my dads system better than any of the nurses there (she worked at that hospital for decades as well) she was able to give sound recommendations which in turn helped my dad recover. The hospital had a strict rule of not allowing any outside food to be brought in but because my mom worked there we were able to arrange with nurses there to bring him food for us (various fruit, smoothies, food that he was normally eating).

Each day he got progressively stronger and the doctors and nurses were amazed that in 2-3 weeks he was able to fully recover and even walk before being released! They removed him off oxygen and he was able to breath on his own towards the end. The doctor had told my mom that COVID would’ve had a much more serious outcome had my dad not have been eating so clean with fruits and vegetables being high in vitamin C/D. 

I know many of you have lost loved ones to COVID and I don’t mean to make your situations seem less important but I wanted to share this feel good moment, because my dad was the LAST person we wanted to get COVID especially when this all started given all his past health conditions. My parents called me on the drive home from the hospital crying with joy, they’ve been through so much and we definitely needed this one win!

TLDR; dad got COVID from our family friend, has numerous health conditions, went to ICU and made a full recovery in 2 weeks partly due to his switch in diet prior.","Wishing your dad a continued safe recovery!

kphlhf,ghxmgo0,My therapist ghosted me.,"My therapist and I have been meeting in person since October. We had to do a Zoom call almost 2 weeks ago because her sitter cancelled.

She never followed up so after a week I texted her and asked if we could make an appointment and how I could pay her for the last session.

Guys, she never responded, lol. I’m starting to think I’ve been ghosted and I’m kind of confused where to go from here? I don’t want to bombard her with text messages but like, if she doesn’t want me to be her client anymore that’s fine, but I’d still like to pay her for the session? I’m beyond confused. I’m considering emailing her or texting her again, but like I said, I don’t want to be annoying. I’m just a little befuddled on where to go from here.","I think with the holidays and that limbo time between the holidays she could’ve gotten busy, lost track of things and/or taken actual time off without sessions. Now, she should’ve definitely told you if she was taking time off and it does sound pretty weird that she’s not responded. 

I would e-mail her rather than text her, and maybe follow up again saying it’s been 3 weeks, you’d like to pay her for the session you did last and you’re worried you haven’t heard from her and wondering whether she still want to work with you or whether you should be looking for someone else. 
I promise you she won’t take offence to you asking that question. It’s perfectly legitimate to ask if you’ve been left hanging like that when therapy should be a regular thing and a constant and you weren’t told whether she was scheduling time off. 
If she does take offence, then all the more reason to find someone else since she’s the one that left you hanging and not you.",0,2,0

mbmkwv,grz6zc8,How to talk about my trauma when I don't fully believe that I deserve to feel traumatized?,"So this has been creeping up on me for a while and my therapist has been putting off having me explain the details until I give her the signal. I'm actually feeling lately like I can't keep carrying it alone, so today might be the day I tell her.

We've been through the childhood stuff, the anxiety disorders, and the very basic details of the sexual stuff (multiple events and multiple people, sort of ""ambiguous"" consent and murky memories of each thing). Last week she asked why I'm protecting them, why I won't tell people in my life what happened and I'm afraid to make honest and private accusations. The truth is that I still don't believe I deserve to feel as horrible about it as I do.

The first thing was a blowjob, that's it. It was my best friend and I liked him a lot and he lied and said he wanted to be with me so he could take my virginity. And in his dorm while no one was there he told me he was going to teach me how to give a blowjob. When he said, ""Ready?"" I told him I was scared and I could feel myself starting to panic, but he pulled up a chair and he said I'd be okay and he held my head down the entire time while I choked and coughed and tears ran all over my face. And I hate admitting that it was something so small because it feels like should have moved on. When my boyfriend now asked why I couldn't do it for him, and I told him, even he seemed to think it was the tiniest thing to be afraid of.

I think the rest of what happened was somewhat my fault, because less than a week after what my friend did I had a first date, and he cancelled the plans. He told me he wasn't feeling well, wanted to go to his house instead. That's how I lost my virginity. I didn't let myself say no, even when he wouldn't wear a condom and it hurt really bad. In the end he just got mad that I bled everywhere, and we kept dating but he slept with a friend of mine. The next time I tried to touch my body was four months later, and I cried.

The recent one was my ex boyfriend. He brought me to his house on our first date (again) and he never asked for consent. He did it again the next night. I feel like this one's on me because we kept dating after, and I gave up on telling him no, and I forced myself to see the sex as a sign that he liked me and wanted to be with me, even though it was all he was willing to do with me and he still slept with other girls the whole time. The narrative our coworkers got was that I was a slut, and he used me, and I've internalized that to the point I'll never really not believe it.

My therapist has been talking a lot about the trauma chairs, how there's self-blame and anger and peace and all that. I spend a lot of time in the anger chair but I always end up back in self-blame. And I almost feel like I don't deserve therapy, and to be carrying all this shit so long after. It makes it harder to open up because I feel like she and everyone else will see my problems the same way, like I brought them on and I'm making a monster out of nothing.","She should see your trauma as what it is - trauma - and for how it has affected you. I spent almost 40 years downplaying what happened to me because it didn’t seem ‘big enough’, but actually it turned out there was so much more to it than the acts themselves. There’s the physical violation -not to be understated- but also the trust broken, and the support that may not have been there, the effects on your self worth and so on and so on. It sounds to me like these individuals abused you, and I think sometimes that becomes all we think we deserve and so it becomes a vicious circle. 
You were abused by people you trusted, that is trauma and you deserve to have help to move past it. You are worth so much more than those people made you feel. I’m so sorry for how they treated you and I hope you can learn that you deserve to be treated with respect. And that includes how you treat yourself.",2,2,0
fzi82b,fn5867z,I'm ignoring everyone,"Basically what the title says. I'm not gonna lie, these past few weeks have been hard and I think that's what triggered my avoidant tendencies. But honestly, I think it's just getting ridiculous; I didn't wish my friend a happy birthday and I always do that, I used to anyway. Today I stopped replying to my my friend's texts mid conversation, because she wanted to watch a movie together online and it just seemed like too much effort. I met a guy on an app, seemed like a genuine dude and I told him I will text him tomorrow. That tomorrow was a 5 days ago. I didn't even reply to a comment (it was basically a conversation under a post) on here (yes, I'm mad about that). I can't bring myself to pick up my friend's call. The next thing I know, I text her a shitty explanation about my mom needing something from me. All of my group chats are muted, I barely say anything there. I don't accept video calls, because again, I just don't feel like talking. 

I don't feel like talking anymore. I still do my day-to-day shit, I even enrolled in an online course to stay sane (and because I like the topic). I just don't have the energy to talk to anyone.","Pshhh.

I'm similar.  My main goal is to find someone on the same wave length as me, get a few cats, and become avoidant recluses together into our golden years.  The problem is, all the asocial recluses are recluding, so I never actually run into them.

Talk about a catch 22.  I don't hate people, but I can't seem to maintain relationships with distance.  I've had a few relationships where we could be completely alone and quiet together.  Where it didn't matter how I acted, because even though we were together will were still completely alone.

Hard to explain...but I just accept that I don't fit in with the super pro-social majority.",0,2,0
nwmzpo,h1h9rl8,Vyvanse 10mg - ADHD or depression?,"Hi! I hope anyone reading has an amazing day. 

I've been taking Cymbalta for 2.5 years now due to anxiety and depression. I recently increased the dosage from 30 to 60 to now 90mg. It has helped my panic disorder and anxiety significantly as this past year was rough due to Covid. 

Yet, I am so tired. I am the sleepiest person I know. I could sleep forever. I work 8-5, so having so much fatigue isn't ideal. When working from home, I sneak in a nap during my lunch hour, but when I'm in the office... no can do. 

I've been with a therapist for years and got a psychiatrist about three months ago. She prescribed me Vyvanse this week due to binge eating and mild undiagnosed ADHD. I've tried adderall before, so I was nervous because I know how that affects anxiety. But, I tried the Vyvanse yesterday, and it was amazing. I wasn't 'cracked out' like I am on Adderall. I felt normal, calm, alert. I felt present in the moment. Which is good because normally I am so focused on the past and future. I just felt there. No fidgeting, no racing heart, or mindless thoughts. Normally, my depression just makes me not be able to do anything... like mentally and physically can't. The thought of getting up and doing a simple task is overwhelming and suffocating. 

I recently found out that some anxiety and depression symptoms are actually ADHD. 

Just thought I would throw out there. Let me know if anyone else has experienced this.","I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression for a long time, and at the urging of my psychotherapist my prescribing Dr. finally agreed to let me try vyvanse as an adjunct to my other meds (though I have treatment resistant depression, so nothing really has ever worked).

I’m hoping that maybe some of my symptoms are undiagnosed ADD/ADHD, after running through a screening with my psychotherapist he definitely thinks I meet the criteria.

I hope I have similar results! Appreciate you sharing your experience.",1,2,0
n9u6jv,gxqax5l,Today is my Birthday,"Hello. I am turning 22 (f) today and  I do not have any friends to go out and celebrate. In fact I never had any real friends, only people that wanted sth from me or they found me physically attractive. I planned a schedule full of studying today , in order to not think about how sad my life has become. I am attending 3 meetings today, 2 online and 1 in an actual room, so i have to look happy and succeed in my assignments, but it is hard. It's hard to go out and watch people in groups walking together and having a good time while I go and get my coffee alone from my favorite cafe. I stopped going for walks alone because I feel more lonely as i see most people in my age group hang out and walk in groups. I succeeded an exam of a course that i took on my own, whereas most people were in teams of 2-3 and i had no one to share that success.. I try my best to succeed so that I can move out of my city and go somewhere else but oh boy it's hard being all alone. I tried making friends but they end up wanting a romantic relationship or they straight up treat me poorly,. I guess this happens because i am introverted and new people usually do come on their own to talk to me on social events (before a pandemic) but their motive was not friendly(keep in mind that i go to a uni that 9/10 are guys), but they would pretend to be my friends for months and when they realized that they cannot be romantic with me by their words they would be mad at me?So I am tired of this situtation and I stopped having contact with these people and I am afraid to meet others from this uni because this keeps happening  for 3 years. I just want someone that actually care about me and  i care about him/her of course, but I kind of lost hope...Sometimes I need a hug that bad so i hug my stuffed animals... Oh and I never been in a romantic relationship because I am afraid i would get hurt... I dont know I just wanted to share those thoughts with someone. I still hope that one day I will have a healthy social life but it is hard to keep going...","Just few things I wanna tell you, 
The Pandemics made it worse and it sucks. 
It sucks being lonely. 
Try a few things, like find some discord rooms you can go hangout in and be a part of the community.  
Usually it's really simple, people are welcoming and there's no prerequisites. 
Alternatively if you were friends with someone,  call them and ask them how they are,  in my experience there's usually no specific reason for drifting apart other than just being caught up in their own shit. 
Check if you may need Therapy, go in for a session.
And a note to everyone, Therapy is not just for the injured or emotionally damaged. You can be in therapy even when your life is going great. It's just a proactive measure. 
Lastly Happy Birthday, I used to tell myself I don't care about people not wishing me on my birthday.  But then you see everyone posting pictures for everyone on social media and you get that FOMO. It really does suck. 
Take care of yourself and if you need any of those links to the discord  then PM me.",2,2,0

fvlw1k,fmlrdvw,My mother died and i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me on the same day.," 

Hey guys, so.. i don't actually know how to tell this, i won't bore you with the whole story. basically, some months ago, i wake up because of my girlfriends phone, it was her gym coach who, i found out, she was having sex with. i stare at the phone in disbelief, i couldn't believe it. and now that? i woke my girlfriend up, yell at her, and ask her to leave.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I wish i could hug my mother in this situation.","That's horrible. I'm so sorry. I've been depressed for over three years and my grandfather passed away recently. That has thrown me down a deep dark hole. I'm here for you, this whole sub is here for you, friends and family members are there for you. If you need to talk, I'm always looking to help and for new friends. 

Also congratulations on taking steps to better yourself, recently I've also lost the motivation to go to the gym, or to better myself. But you've gone and done it, which is amazing!!!

hkn26r,fwtnq6l,Needy friend,"There is this new friend (F20), I (F21) met at a party and we really liked each other and got closer. Usually because it’s new friendship me and he would chat for hours till morning and say good night and good morning everybody for about a month which was great. Being an introvert, I love to do things in my own time alone and I get exhausted by long talks and calls especially if they are very frequent. Anyways, this friend made it clear that she wants to be a party of my life and wants us to communicate EVERYDAY, so I told her how I’m an introvert and maybe it’s not the best thing but I could try it out. As expected I ended up really emotionally drained and exhausted because we talk everyday (all day literally texting every hour) we end up always fighting. “Why are you not responding?” “I keep sending you cute texts but you don’t deserve it”. 

The fights consist of me being really calm and trying to understand because she is the one that has a problem with me everyday. I texted her saying that I’m really tired and I want to sleep, she got really upset and called 15 times until I replied I want to sleep it’s 5 am. I told her that I CANT do the texting every day. but she said she doesn’t want to. I told her I wanted a break explaining to her I just need to rest and I don’t want any texts or calls. Obviously she did the obvious, I had to mute her and she still went to my UNIVERSITY email and sent me a “love letter”. I called her after a week explaining to her AGAIN why she needs to stop. She has problems in her house and she has health issues and I’ve always been with her through it and tried to be a good friend. Even after the call she said she understood and STILL texted me but she never called, in my head I knew I shouldn’t respond but knowing her attitude she’d cry later. 

She would send me flowers and accessories during the pandemic which my parents really had an issue with, she stopped. at this point it has become a burden instead of a gift, I felt shackled in the friendship because she sent an accessory, told her thank you and that I loved it “so when is your “break” going to finish?”, I felt like she didn’t respect my feeling at that point and I told her to give me a couple of days EVEN though I would still reply to her and text her back in my so called “break”. 

She has no right to get mad at me because I request two more days until the month is done. Now, my break was over “officially” even though I was still mentally drain because she wouldn’t leave me alone, I went about my day as usual and texted her once and she didn’t respond for hours. then she texted me saying “why are you not talking to me? Do you not want me in you’re life? You’re confusing me” and I’m like ?? I told you what I want and you said you’ll work on giving me the space I needed. So I told her to stop thinking that because it’s not the case and I literally texted her hours ago. And now she went back to her crazy long texting 23 text messages and each message is as big as this essay lol. I honestly ignored it at this point and don’t plan on reading it anytime soon. 

The problems she gave to me I NEVER told her that I am mentally exhausted because of her or that the break I need is because of her, I never told her that I was so depressed for TWO MONTHS because of her and I couldn’t focus on my schoolwork, not sleeping enough, not eating enough I lost 5 kgs in just 4 weeks. But when she talks she has this way of playing victim and that she loves me and that she’s the best thing that can ever come in my life and that I hurt her and I was the reason she cried at night and I was the reason she ended up in the hospital because she fainted even though the reason she fainted was because she already has health issues meaning it’s a reacquiring thing but she HAD to make it like “yeah a part of it is because of you”. 

She makes me feel like I am the worst friends and I keep questioning myself every step of the way and making me feel guilty because I don’t want to do what she wants and I am tired of compromising.

I just hope I did the right thing at this point because the guilt trip she gave me is eating me alive.","Do you benefit from this friendship? Nothing is wrong with balancing the benefits you receive from this relationships (she makes me laugh, we have fun together, she supports me when I need it etc) against the stress you get from this relationship. I have a problem with people pleasing so let me spell this out for you: you don't owe anything to anyone!! Doesn't matter all the cute and nice things she thought she was doing. Please don't feel bad about thinking about yourself first.",2,2,2
n4g3ti,gwvto7u,All about not missing a dose.,"I started my sobriety and life as an HIV+ person on the same day. I’m handling the staying sober better than my diagnoses. I spent a month in the ICU. Got a concussion and had pneumonia and encephalitis. Because of the concussion and encephalitis, my memory is shit. Large parts of my past are unreachable. I don’t remember my month in the ICU. My mom and little brother came over to see me…and I don’t remember that. And that makes me very sad. I missed thanksgiving and Christmas. My best friend of 26 years was there everyday and I don’t remember that. I came out sober, but felt so extremely terrible for not being able to remember things. The harder I tried the more frustrated I got. I remember when I started my HIV meds I couldn’t remember off I took them. Not supposed to double up. Not supposed to miss one either. I’m good now, I have a little box with the days of the week on it. Every visit I get asked, “Are you still taking your medication? You know you can’t miss one dose.” And every morning when I do take them, I’m reminded of a stupid mistake I made. Also reminds me there’s a virus in me trying everyday to kill me. Just a constant reminder I can do without. Anyway, that’s it. That’s a small part of my story. Thanks for reading…","You are not responsible for catching HIV. You drew the short straw and got unlucky for something that billions of people do every day without consequence. You were randomly infected and can never blame yourself.

50 years ago women that dressed provocatively were blamed if they were sexually assaulted. That mindset was toxic and robbed generations of women of their right to justice.

I totally understand your memory dilema. I take pain medication and have a shocking memory. I've double dosed before and been totally sick. It's good you use the pill box. I use an app to track that I have taken the pill and make it a habit to record every time I take a dose. No double doses so far.

I was very ignorant about HIV just a few years ago until a friend became positive. His experience was an education. While he educated me that he would have a normal life and the medication meant he wouldn't make anyone else sick, he still took his life. My understanding was his partner forgave him, but the parents were not supportive.

if you can't find it in yourself not to blame yourself, please forgive yourself. You've done nothing wrong.

God bless you.",2,2,0

k2qckb,gdwx080,I work for CPS.,"Even if this is never read, I’m posting it for myself. It’ll be short with questionable formatting due to mobile.

Most CPS investigators in America are recent college grads (I regularly see coworkers aged 21-30 involved with families that have children so close to the investigator’s age, they could’ve gone to school together). CPS is bottom of the barrel social work that anyone with a Bachelor’s can do - which I’m not discrediting, but most of us don’t have any licensure. 

Work may start off easy (while learning), but it quickly turns traumatic. Child abuse/neglect is something we don’t think about if it doesn’t effect us, because it’s abnormal. Seeing abnormalities routinely is impactful on our young minds. I just can’t describe some of the things I’ve seen. And I promise I’m not just trying to seek pity. 

Managers primarily care about numbers and statistics. Child safety is talked about but if you pay attention, that’s not the primary focus. For example, workers can be terminated for late reports (reports not submitted within 30 days of receiving a complaint). Imagine not having requested records from weeks prior and getting in trouble for this? It happens. Nothing to do with child safety.

CPS doesn’t stop for a pandemic because child abuse doesn’t stop. Our work has fundamentally increased our exposure and not much has changed. We’ve never been recognized as essential workers since we’re not in the medical field (which is ironic because I’m in the hospital 3x/week for work). 

The turnover is understandably high. I worry many investigators don’t care and just stay here to put in time, since it really is a newbie social worker job. It’s just sad. And I’m stressed. 

Hug a social worker - or, to prevent the spread, just thank one. I know I said I don’t need pity but maybe I do. I just want normalcy i guess. Is that too much to ask?

Thanks.","So cps workers aren’t even trained that well, that is shit.

jx2mla,gcv2vsx,My grandfather just passed to Covid and I blame my mom for it...,"So... I lived in a household of 4. It was my mom, my grandparents and myself. Now it's just the 3 of us.  


Here's some backstory:  


My grandfather raised me. I've never met my biological father, but it didn't matter because I had my grandfather. I've been by his side since I was born. I always followed him everywhere and I learned everything I know from him. He taught me to analyze and problem solve which is not a skill everyone possesses.  


Anyways...  


My mom has worked at a job for 21 years. During the pandemic, the company went under and was forced to sell, so she was left unemployed in September.

I came up with a plan that she get on unemployment for a little bit while the pandemic is happening so 1.) she could be safe, but 2.) so we could apply to a few different positions that would be upgrades from her previous job. Considering she had 21 years of experience, we could find her something that had better pay and benefits.   
I thought it was a solid plan...  


My grandmother got in her head and convinced her that she needed to apply for a job ASAP, even if it was low level and a step down from the job she had before. I talked to her again and tried to convince her that it was illogical and that my plan made more sense in the long run. Nope, she decided to follow what my grandmother said and applied with the company that bought the company she worked for before.  


Sure enough, there's a manager there and right away my mom disliked him because he was very condescending. He was much younger than everyone who worked there and he was also quite careless. He got sick and would show up to work without wearing a mask. In fact, he got tested for Covid and it came back positive but he showed up to work the next day as a ""surprise"" to the staff.  


So my mom ends up getting sick and decides she was going to quit because of the manager and the ""hostile"" environment. So she quits after being there for 3 weeks and brings it home and of course all 4 of us get Covid with pneumonia.  


Anyways, long story long, my grandpa didn't survive Covid and I feel lot's of regret because I couldn't be there to comfort him during his struggle. I couldn't be there as they removed the breathing tubes and he slowly suffocated for a day. I couldn't be there for any of it. And since I was sick, my last interaction with him was calling him on FaceTime and telling him that I loved him before the ambulance took him. It kills me because now that he's gone I'm hearing that he was scared and he didn't want to be intubated...  


I'm mad at my mom because I came up with a plan for her... It was a solid plan. And get this... after she quit her job, she came home and applied for unemployment and started applying for better jobs JUST LIKE I HAD ADVISED HER TO!!!  


Why quit now though? You killed my grandpa so why quit now? Why listen now? Go back to your job and stay there...","Sounds like a lot of people had a hand to play in this situation. Your grandma first of all because she pressured your mother into making that decision. Your mother for giving in to grandma’s demands. And finally the supervisor and place of employment for allowing an unsafe work environment to exist. Your hurt and disappointment are valid but are only being directed at your mother. Why is this?
Anyways, I hope you heal and feel your grandfather’s warmth and love around you. I’m sorry that this happened to you.",2,0,2

jpi4s2,gbeu6l7,Starting my journey to a healthy relationship with food,"TW: weight and eating disorder discussion

A little bit of backstory, I've always had a complicated relationship with food and body image, due to beauty standards and childhood bullying (I wasn't targeted for weight issues specifically, but I've never been the slender athletic type of girl and I've always felt slightly out of place among my peers). Over the summer of 2020 I lost about 6 kg and reached a weight that I was comfortable with under the guidance of a nutritionist. I went to uni and it all came crumbling down. My course is really intense and being a 1st year while going through a pandemic is so incredibly emotionally demanding, since this is the year you're supposed to socialise with people and make new friends. Instead, I had to quarantine for a month in total so far (and I've got another month to go since I am travelling between uni and my home country for Christmas), I've only really been able to socialise with the people in my flat (who are great, I just wish I could meet others as well) and I've been bombarded with emails from my university about how, although this year is ""different"", they hope we're still having a good time. I know they are trying their best and I appreciate that, but it's just frustrating to hear them talk about ""having a fun authentic uni experience"" when more students have committed suicide during lockdown than have died from covid. Overall, it's just been an awful year for everybody, and although there are people in much worse situations than me, this is my story and I felt I needed to share it somewhere, in case other students see it and maybe feel even slightly less alone.
Anyway, 1 month into my course and I began having these night cravings, around 12-1 am. I'll be fine during the day, eat healthy and trying to maintain my weight, but it's like a switch flipped in my brain at night and I would get these super intense horrible cravings where I felt like if I didn't eat something right there and then I would simply die. So I would go to the fridge, stuff my face with all the random stuff I could find until I was physically uncomfortable. I would be completely mentally absent during these binges, to the point where I couldn't even remember what I ate. After, I would go back to bed and feel ashamed and disgusted with myself, thinking about how pathetic it was that my only way to deal with stress was to shove insane amounts of food down until I couldn't feel anything else than the pain caused by how full I was. I never threw up after the binges simply because I am afraid of throwing up, I've always had an irrational fear of it. The saddest part is that I considered the people who throw up ""brave"" for doing it and beat myself up for not being like them. I am scared that if this continues, at some point the fear of throwing up will not be enough to stop me from doing it and i will end up in the ""binge and purge"" cycle. I am aware that these are symptoms of binge eating disorder, but they have only been going on for 1.5 months so far, so if I stop now I'll have a chance to not let it become an actual disorder.
I have gained 2 kg back and I want to stop, because I know how uncomfortable I am at a higher weight. I believe the binges are caused by restricting too much and focusing on calories instead of how filling and nutritious a meal is, so I will start by not counting the calories for each meal and trying listen to my hunger cues. Eat when I'm hungry, stop when I'm full. I will also try to include more exercise in my daily routine, but I'll try things like hiking and walking instead of workouts aimed at burning calories.

I am ready to finally have a good relationship with food and body image, after struggling with it ever since I was 11. I am sorry for the long post and possibly the bad English (not my first language), but I'm glad I have a platform where I can share this, and maybe some people going through the same thing will read it and feel less alone.","(I'm not a nutritionist) Honestly, if your nutritionist never said, you need to structure your meals. 

Rather than starve yourself and then eat when your hungry. Set times and stick to them.

You might do better with eating Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Or you might do better breaking those meals up into smaller portions and eating them at set times during the day so rather than eating 3 times, your eating 5-6 smaller things a day. 

It is really difficult, especially with stress, stomach acid can build up and cause intense pain or feeling of hunger. Controlling your stress levels will help a lot as well.

If you have structure in your eating, planning what your going to eat, healthy amounts and stick to the same times, your body and mind will get used to eating at those times rather than randomly eating when ever you feel like it.

It sets your up much better, it's hard to begin with but if you stick it out you will get used to it.

I really hope you get some control over this and back on track. You can do this!",2,2,0

ljk0b9,gnex2cq,Stop mistaking distance for my sanity w me disliking you.,"I’ve been dealing with really bad mental illness for years. But it’s something about being forced to quarantine thats making me reach a new low. I’m like a flower that hasn’t been watered in weeks. Brain running on autopilot and don’t have the capacity to do anything faster than a slug squirming on the concrete. As a result I’m spending more time away from people, I don’t have the energy to commit to a conversation. 

I am much more quiet at work now, And I text back super late which is not the usual me. But that’s just me needing alone time because I’m very overwhelmed with my thoughts, it’s giving suicidal ideation.

Pills that my doctor prescribed me aren't doing anything, I just wanna die, or, as I prefer It, fall into a deep coma for years. But unfortunately, you cant make yourself fall into a coma like that, and death Is also cheaper, and I wont worry anybody anymore. I cry a lot for a person who drinks less than 100 ml of water a day. I wish I was back In my childhood (well, I'm technically still in my childhood years), running around outside with my friends back in my old kintergarden, playing video games with my brother and watching innocent little videos. I don't even allow myself to cry, cause all my life when I cried, my brother and my dad told me to shut up, and that no one wants to hear me whine.
I talk to myself every day, as If I had a YouTube channel,
making a video. Except there's no camera, and It's just me being insane. I also am talking to god or my dead grandparents sometimes. I dont have any friends that I could hang out with. I have never In my life bullied, but being all alone Is not the best either. The only things that bring me joy and/or a smile on my face are memes, drawing, and video games.

Please advise. Thank You. I hope I was articulate enough with this thought/thoughts.","Coming from personal experience, it's very difficult for many people to grasp what you are actually going through.

We don't talk about it publicly.""

I lost close to 30 friends of mine in a single go because of circumstances beyond my control. I didn't have anyone else to reach out to at that moment.

But do I regret it? Absolutely not! Since I was a kid, I have always wanted to create impact. Bring about a change. Two years back, it would have been in school education. Now, it is in mental health. Coming from a country where mental illness is highly stigmatised, I want to raise awareness. And I do it in my own small ways. For now. Recently had my own Webinar about it too. I have a lot more I want to do. I am working towards the same.

I personally feel the more people will talk about it and educate people, the more it will give other people the courage to seek help... especially the ones who don't know that they are unknowingly struggling within. Also. It is important for people to know that everyone deserves compassion. And a right to be treated normally without being seen as attention seeking. A diabetic being vocal about his health issues would never be called an attention seeker.",0,2,0
kcay94,gfrny9q,I [M29] am foreigner living for 4 years in London without any new friends/girlfriend around my age. Tried Tinder/Okcupid/Instagram - still alone and lonely + started working from home - my mental health is getting worse - long post,"Hi Reddit, I need to share something... 

**About me:**

I'm turning 29 at the beginning of 2021. I've moved to UK for studies and for a better life, so I'm not planning to go back to my home country. English is also not my native language. I'm working in a large global company making above 3000£ per month which I think is quite good for someone of my age. I am 6 feet tall, fit - working out regularly for years around 3 times a week. So I'd say I am relatively good looking, educated and have a good income. 

**My story:**

For the past 4 years I live alone. I am staying in a house share, but never met anyone here with whom I could get along with mostly because these were people who had came to London temporarily for work and left after few months + most of them were much older. So it was fine to chit-chat in the kitchen sometimes but that's it. 

At my company I am working only with males (mostly in their late 30 or 40+, it is very rare to see a women of my age in my office(floor), so I have never had a chance to meet any girl at work. I always thought that at a company like mine in London I will be able to meet with someone but unfortunately I was wrong. After 3 years I still have a contact with same age group of people who are mostly married and with kids and now  WFH kicked in as well. 

I'd like to meet someone who is similar in terms of career goals and education level.

**My dates:**

Since I felt lonely I stared using dating apps. It's a pain... but I managed to date few girls. First one was a nurse, she was okay but what was weird; she was carrying everywhere her best gay friend, and she was mentioning him very often(i have no problem with gays), once we were on a date (maybe only  I thought I am on a date?) and that guy just joined out of nowhere at our meeting, so awkward... all in all... it didn't last long.

Another one was a student from Asia. I really like her, she came to do MBA, she was educated and intelligent, overconfident but she also had two faces... that other one was drinking and all that stuff. She had a lot of alcohol and weed at her place. Every weekend she was getting drunk, smoke, going to a night club etc. for me it was a bit too much but anyway I had a chance to date someone whom I was into. It was fun but one night she was doing a birthday party so she invited her friends and me as well but she asked me to pretend we are not dating (we were for few months already) and I am just friend, it was soo weird and I didnt feel good about it. We all got drunk that evening.. she didn't want me to be close to her or even dance with me, so I was just on a side... and her other drunk friend somehow came to me and started kissing me... and without more details that how this relation finished. 

I met also with some other girls from Thailand and Brazil but it didn't work long term cause they were not speaking english well and we didn't have much common topics to talk about + they were not exactly what I am looking for but still it was nice to be with someone around for some time. 

**My online dates:**

I also had few online girls which were lonely like me and were looking for someone on the internet. Just not to make this post too long I'll briefly say that they were from asia. With first one i talked around a year but she end up finding someone else in UK and got married(guy in his late 30).

Another one I knew for almost 2 years, we met twice in India but at the end she told me that her parents forced her into arranged marriage, so it would be a huge disgrace for her family if she would call that off.  It hurt me for a long time cause we knew each other really well. We were talking daily. 4 months before her marriage we were on holiday together and slept together. She told me that if I'd tell her earlier that we may be together then maybe it could work. 

The third one was also from India but she found me on Tinder in London. I think she is even in worse situation than me cause she used to date a lot of foreigners in her country but she end up being alone and now she would like to start a family and have a kid but she has no one - we just stopped talking but again it was good for me to have someone I could talk to.

Currently I am doing similar thing as above with another girl from Asia who has found me on instagram. She works in similar field as me, so there is always something to talk about and we understand each other quite well. We can't meet because of covid and she also used to date bunch of guys there but anyway... I feel I am wasting time as in the cases above and at the end of the day I'll just waste a lot of time talking with her.

**Covid times:**

Now during pandemic I try online dating again but it doesn't work really, got some matches here and there but I don't really like my matches. I found few girls on Instagram which I like but I am not sure if I could actually go on a date with someone whom I found on Instagram?

I think scrolling dating apps and instagram looking for someone I could match with had negative impact on my mental health cause very often I feel disappointment, saddens, rejection. Unfortunately, I also developed a habit of masturbation which is sometimes few times a day if I am off work and I spend too much time on those apps.  I haven't slept with any girl for more than a year now and I feel like I am also missing that but I don't want to have sex with any random girl, I need to feel that connection with that person otherwise it is better to jerk off alone and move on with life. 

My other problem is 'Work From Home'. My company does not allow anyone come back to the office till April at least. I am only renting a single room so it is a madness sometimes. It feels like being in prison. I work from this place, I eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. I spend my weekends here... madness... before at least I could go to the office, meet people from work, go for a lunch together, drinks or some social activities after work... now it's no longer available and will not be for a long time. Since I live 30 min from central London, I was thinking that maybe renting a whole flat in central London would give me more opportunities to meet new people? Currently I am living in quiet area full of families with kids and pensioners not much is really happening locally.

**My main issues:**

I'd like to find someone long term and just move on with my life and career... all that dating thing is a huge waste of time to me but on the other hand I don't want to be with someone just of sake of having someone. I don't know how am I supposed to meet someone. Office didn't work and with WFH posture will become even more difficult. I saw on reddit people advice to join some clubs... but what I am supposed to join? Ballet dance club? I joined football club and yea it was male only.  I also don't have any friends of my age here, so I never got invited anywhere. People also advised to try clubs or pubs... but I feel going alone to the pub and talking to random girls is weird, especially that my english is not perfect and I also have an accent.

I'd like to keep focus on my career and further education but all those dating apps, instagram and people i meet there are distracting me but if I cut it off then I feel like something is  missing in my life, that I have noone to talk to (it is quite often that I have a days when I don't open my mouth to anyone and just talk to myself in my mind).

I don't know what to do with my life now... I have a good job, money... I am a bit scary that I'll end up being 35 and will be in the same point dating-wise. I'd  like to find someone around 26yo, so that the girl doesn't have that pressure on her that she has to have a baby very soon. I am worried that it may be a case if I meet a girl in her 30.

Since you already know my past... the other issue is actually talking about that to a new person which I met when she asks about my social life cause as you can see it is weird. I don't know how to change that. All that makes me feel more and more overwhelmed and depressed. There is also no one I could share that with cause people would think I am freaking out here and also I am sure that if I'd share that with someone that person wouldn't keep it in secret.

What I should do now with my life? I am stuck... sometimes I feel maybe I should move to Asia where more girls would find me interesting.. I really don't know.

jxdsin,gcvwxts,My mother is the 1%. She has a name.,"We got one of those Front Steps Projects photos done in late April. My husband and I, and our dog, too. We thought it would be a nice memory of the quarantine, which would be a short, unique event. 

What you don't know is that less than 10 minutes before the picture was taken I received a phone call that my mother had tested positive for covid.  

17 days later she was gone.

My adult relationship with my mother was strained. This does not make her passing any less personal.  I'm working through the grief with a therapist.

This pandemic has become so irreparably polarizing and politicized. I do genuinely understand that stay-at-home orders are negatively affecting businesses, working parents, school children, seniors and that mental health issues are on the rise. I trust the numbers, the scientists and the guidance that, until there is widespread distribution of a vaccine, we need to do our part to stop the spread and prevent more deaths. There will be consequences and collateral damage, unfortunately.

People dismiss it as nothing more than the flu. Covid-19 has killed 6x more people in a shorter period than the flu does annually, if you trust the numbers, which I do. People are dismissing anything deemed “complications from covid” as a non-covid death inflating the numbers. The fact remains that had that person not gotten covid, they wouldn’t have gotten the complication they succumbed to, like my mother. 
You’re being dismissive on a technicality and missing the point. If she hadn’t gotten covid, she wouldn’t have died. Period. End of story.

Some people aren't interested in taking measures that might prevent further spread of this highly infectious virus, assuming that it won’t affect them or anyone around them. People think stay at home, small groups and social distancing requests are communism at work. Or that masks aren’t manly or that they are a political statement. This breaks my heart. This is not communism-this is community. This is humanity trying to come together to save lives. 

I have to wonder what your thought process is or what your moral fiber is that you wouldn’t want to help your neighbor with a simple gesture like a mask or social distancing.  People assert that we shouldn't take it so seriously because there is such a low mortality rate at just 1%. How insensitive.

That 1% is my mother. That 1% is a human being. Two hundred fifty thousand human beings, in fact. When you throw those statements around you are diminishing Sharon's life and my grief. 

We teach our children to be kind and compassionate. Adults could and should lead by example.

Reframe your thinking, please, and put a name on your numbers before you use them to defend your ignorance or not doing your part. That 1% is Sharon Shaughnessy: proud Irish lass from Roxbury, Mass, mother of four, grandmother of five and lover of fresh Dunkins coffee. Sharon's seat at the table is empty this year. 

Nate wanted to cancel the photoshoot but I forged ahead. Given this was our #FrontStepsProject photo shoot capturing pandemic quarantine, it seemed sadly fitting. When I see this photo now I don’t see Nate or Doug; I see my mother. I see the words said to me that day and over the following 17:

“I’m sorry, your mother has tested positive.” 

“I’m sorry, we have to transport your mother to the hospital.”

“I’m sorry, she is not improving. She now has pneumonia.”

“I’m sorry, you need to make a decision about hospice. Yes, we can make an exception for you to see her in person.”

“Sally, we’re too late. She’s gone.”

Be kind. Be thoughtful with your words. Wear a mask. Do your part. I don’t wish this on anyone.

n9u6jv,gxsx052,Today is my Birthday,"Hello. I am turning 22 (f) today and  I do not have any friends to go out and celebrate. In fact I never had any real friends, only people that wanted sth from me or they found me physically attractive.

I am attending 3 meetings today, 2 online and 1 in an actual room, so i have to look happy and succeed in my assignments, but it is hard. It's hard to go out and watch people in groups walking together and having a good time while I go and get my coffee alone from my favorite cafe. I stopped going for walks alone because I feel more lonely as i see most people in my age group hang out and walk in groups. I succeeded an exam of a course that i took on my own, whereas most people were in teams of 2-3 and i had no one to share that success.. I try my best to succeed so that I can move out of my city and go somewhere else but oh boy it's hard being all alone.

I guess this happens because i am introverted and new people usually do come on their own to talk to me on social events (before a pandemic) but their motive was not friendly(keep in mind that i go to a uni that 9/10 are guys), but they would pretend to be my friends for months and when they realized that they cannot be romantic with me by their words they would be mad at me?So I am tired of this situtation and I stopped having contact with these people and I am afraid to meet others from this uni because this keeps happening  for 3 years. I just want someone that actually care about me and  i care about him/her of course, but I kind of lost hope...Sometimes I need a hug that bad so i hug my stuffed animals... Oh and I never been in a romantic relationship because I am afraid i would get hurt... I dont know I just wanted to share those thoughts with someone.

jm2uga,gat002i,My dad threated to light himself up,"I'm 20. My dad always been physically abusive, emotionally abuse and very manipulative for years. he also has a short temper. the only thing that got me through when i was in school that i would grow up and go to college and move away from. he stopped being physically abuse for a few years. i reasoned with myself that he is a nice person. that he did it because he wanted us to live a good life. but he did in all wrong ways. we are all  corona positive in my house except my brother. we are isolating. he has one conversation with my brother and he starts blowing up. he threatens to leave the house. twice in 2 hours. he always finds a way to blackmail us to listen to him. my mom dragged him inside. after that he grabbed a paper, lit it up and threatened to burn himself. i threw water on him and told him to go to hell and that he is not my dad anymore. i have locked myself in my room and i can stay here for a few days. but mentally i dont know what to do. any advice?","You already realized that he is abusive and manipulative. You know that he's blackmailing you when he's trying to get you to do who knows what. Knowing this is a very important first step to start to get out of this. The next step is realizing that you do not have to put up with this behavior. The next time he does this, or something similar, call the police. There's clearly a lot of stuff you need to work through. Same with your mother and brother. 

There are many resources about how you can get out of situations like these. Don't be afraid to get outside help as well. Over here (Germany) there have been posters, as well as prints on milk cartons, of a number to reach out to in case of domestic abuse ever since the lockdowns started. Maybe they've done that where you live as well. If not, you still can find these numbers through the internet. Hell, even some subreddits on here may be able to help you. There are countless people on here who have been through something similar. 

I'm sorry that you have to go through this. Know that you don't have to put up with this. Whatever kind of screws your father has loose, it doesn't give him the right to behave like that towards anybody. Like I said, don't be afraid to get outside help.

I recently have been diagnosed with panic disorder/“severe anxiety that’s the root of it all” and I’ve seen many people talking about taking antidepressants for anxiety only to find out not only did the have horrible anxiety, they were also depressed and didn’t know it. These are all things I’ve felt for quite a long time, but the panic attacks started 3 months ago have made things much worse such as

-not happy not sad kind of just “meh” 90% of most days
-very little motivation for larger tasks (such as working out, cleaning house/room, doing homework) but don’t mind doing “little” things such as cooking...and I guess that’s it
-when Covid first struck I was so happy to be in my room playing video games for 10 months and absolutely had no desire to see people/hangout, that’s changed now, I don’t like playing video games but want to be near people. 
-I wake up most days physically refreshed but mentally like there’s a fog or a weight on my brain that just makes me want to lay down and close my eyes all day.
-I have very high hopes for the future but they usually get thrown out the window by “what does it matter in the long run?” 

So please I would like any input or any stories on other on how they realized they were depressed? Because if the symptoms/things I stated above happened to a lot of people then I’ve been depressed for a very...very long time and haven’t even known it till the panic attacks."," 

Hi! Thank you for sharing your story with us. I understand what predicament you find yourself in right now. I am here to tell you that you are not alone. Sadness is something that we all experience from time to time. For some, this feeling is temporary, and it goes away on its own. But for others, this persistent feeling of emptiness, unhappiness, and hopelessness is becoming a regular part of their day. Here are some ways that depression manifests for people:

* It feels like there is no way out. Everything feels hopeless like there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
* Concentration and focus become much more difficult, which makes any kind of decision-making challenging. 
* It feels like there is no pleasure or joy in life.
* It also has a significant impact on sleep. This often manifests as trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or feeling tired upon waking despite getting an adequate number of hours of sleep.
* Sometimes depression can be physically painful. It is not unusual for people with depression to feel body aches, headaches, muscle tension, and even nausea.

If you are experiencing more than a few symptoms of depression or are worried that your symptoms are worsening, it may be helpful to schedule an appointment with your doctor or mental health expert to help yourself.

To answer your query about whether depression and panic attacks are linked: Panic disorders can be brought on by overwhelming anxiety, and anxiety disorders are usually found in people who are also dealing with depression. It is also common for both conditions to co-occur when they appear.

i3qpkl,g0ehdkl,I deserve to be locked up away out of society forever.,"I'm a terrible person. I deserve to be punished. I don't deserve to live in society with everyone else. There is no justification for me to have the same freedoms and privileges as the hard-working, contributing, law-abiding members of society.

There's a problem. I don't want to actually hurt anyone or take anyone else's property.

I'm wondering if the best way is to just walk up to a judge on the street and say (as calmly and non-maliciously as possible) ""Your honor, I have contempt for you."" and just let them hold me indefinitely for contempt of court. And should they decide to let me out after a time, I just have to find another judge and repeat.

At least that way, I don't hurt anyone (hopefully that includes the judge's feelings) and I am taken away and society will be safe from my horrible personage.

I no longer talk about him to anyone, have packed up his things or things that remind me of him and hid them at my parents house, and shut down any conversations regarding him if someone brings him up. My sister posted on Instagram the year anniversary of his death and I made her untag me because I do not want to be associated with reminders.

It is my son, so I can’t avoid reminders of him, but I got off face book, due to constant reminders and not being able to handle how everyone else is just moving along in normal life.  Early on I tried “sound baths”. Which provided some relief..my faith took a heavy blow, and it is challenging for me to believe but Eben Alexander’s book about his near death experience provided some comfort and peace. I don’t look at old photos because even the happy ones cause me pain.  
Suicide loss definitely causes PTSD type symptoms - was on heavy duty antidepressants that helped, but it was numbing so I’ve been cutting back but then the pain creeps in.  I am still trying to figure out how to deal with the grief.  I had a heart attack 2 years in.  I KNOW it was because of the stress and grief, so don’t ignore warning signs and do not let them tell you it’s just anxiety or grief... they sent me home the first time I went in....I made it and have 2 stents in my heart but that was just luck and me going back a second time.   This is weird to say, but I wish someone had told me to accept that the grief will be there with you all the time.  It doesn’t go away.  I can work and function at “almost” normal, and no one around me notices, but it’s like there is a volcano of grief inside me.  Sometimes the lava just oozes out slowly and painfully.  Sometimes it erupts like Mt San Helen, and takes me down.  I try to avoid triggers, but they are everywhere.  I no longer talk to friends because they are so “normal” and happy.  I seem antisocial because I HATE small talk and crowds.   
I never realized in our culture how invasive our small talk is.  “So, are you married? How many children do you have... and if you get past that one... are they in college?  What do they do for a living?
   I’ve kept a candle on everyday for the last 6 years, since then I’ve added a candle for my mom and my dad who have both passed away as well.  I think my refuge for those first few years was my dad.  He felt the loss like I did.  We wouldn’t talk about it but we were both in the same boat and it was just an understanding we had I guess of how horrible it was.  
I wish there was a 30 day rehab type clinic...like there is for drugs and alcohol.  Somewhere that others understand your struggles and there is  intense therapy and you are taught healthy coping skills.  Your life will go on, and you will be ok.  You need to find what helps you and not give up

ik4q5r,g3ih6qe,My boyfriend wasn't attracted to me when we first met," 

I'm just annoyed I guess. 

Like the title says, a few days ago my boyfriend and I were talking and he revealed that when we first met he didn't find me attractive, but that he's very attracted to me now. There's a lot of context to this conversation and I won't go into all the details, but I've always felt a little insecure that he never tried to pursue me during the first year we knew each other even though we had a really great connection and he was pretty forward with a few other girls. 

According to him, I had a ""glow up"" right before we started dating and that he started noticing me more during that time. He says that we probably would've gotten together anyways even if I didn't have a ""glow up"" just because we had such great chemistry, but part of me doubts that. I see what he means because I definitely grew more into my features (we were pretty young), but it still hurts because I really don't think I changed all that much. 

This revelation kind of hit hard because I started thinking about other events that have happened in the past and it occurred me that he wasn't the only one who thought I was unattractive when I was younger. Growing up, not many guys showed interest in me while most of my girlfriends had many admirers, but I never let this bother me too much because I've always thought fairly highly of myself. To me, I'd never experienced a relationship simply because it just wasn't meant to be. 

Side story - someone once saw a picture of me dressed up (I wasn't even wearing heavy makeup) and acted really shocked at how good I looked. I've never seen myself as unattractive (save for a few random moments of insecurity). To me, I've always been me. The face I see when I wake up in the morning and when I go to sleep at night is the same and has been the same my whole life. I haven't gone through any drastic transformations or anything, I just got older. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and we've had a really great relationship. He's changed a lot and grew up since we first met so I have no doubt that he's not the same person as he once was. We have great chemistry and he's the one I want to spend my future with. He's so loving and sweet and I don't think I harbor any resentment against him for this, but I still can't help but feel hurt/sad. 

I feel a little silly about having an existential crisis during a global pandemic about something dumb that happened 5 years ago that doesn't even matter anymore, but feelings are what they are. 

I'm not really sure what the point of this post is, but I just had to get this off my chest. Have a nice day y'all.","But when he got to know you he wanted to be in your life now for 4 years +

iivflc,g39lijg,I just... hate my life.,"Disclaimer: I don't have anything specific that I want to get off my chest, but rather it's – well – everything I have. So this post might sound like the ramblings of a mad-man, sorry in advance. But I really need to just vent a little..

\--

I genuinely don't know what I should do, I feel trapped by my entire life. I hate it. Currently, after the Corona “break” everything is just crushing down on me. I'm graduating early next year, still without a plan. I wanted to reach out to my mother in hopes of support, but she's usually preoccupied with my little sibling (who needs the attention, they are a toddler after all) or busy with other stuff. I feel like I'm in the way, all the time, even though she told me I'm not.   

My home life is what I can only describe as shit. My mother's boyfriend is in my eyes just a useless, egoistic and lazy piece of shit, who never learned what it means to be a “family” (even though I'll never accept him as part of my family anyway). I could write an entire post just about him and why I despise him so much... But well, we kinda depend financially on him. It's always so stressful at home, either the two are fighting, yelling at the dog (I don't want to get into this particular situation more, let's leave it at this), occupying my sibling or ignoring each other. And I'm the idiot who just shuts up and goes to their room, headphones on, playing loud music, destroying my ears, just to finally get some peace and quiet.   

I genuinely can't wait to move out, even though I'm neither mentally nor physically ready for that. I don't want to blame my mother or stepdad (who she divorced not too long ago), but I felt left alone a lot. I only realised this recently, as a child I was actually happy about so much time that I could spend however I wanted, but now I get that I was indeed kind of... lonely. From about age 11 or 12, not quite sure, I started to barely leave my room. I did go out to meet friends from time to time, but that was about it. We never did anything as a family. 

Nowadays I have a hard time getting out of my room. I see it as my golden cage, kinda. It's my safe space, but also my prison. I can do fun stuff here, but don't. I could leave anytime, but also can't. Something in my head prevents me from actually going out and “living”, if that makes sense... I waste my time. Every day. Every day I repeat the same routine and I feel like I'm going crazy. I never get anything done. I can't get anything done. It's always too loud. I never have any energy or motivation. I'm scared of opening up. I'm scared of going outside. I want to leave this life behind, leave my room, my home, my country. But I'm also desperately clinging to it.  

I hate to go outside, I'm almost scared of doing that. There's so much I can't calculate, so many people, paths, dangers.... It's too much. And the whole global pandemic isn't helping either.. I mean, I kinda like wearing a mask actually, it makes me feel safe in a way, but that's it. 

I think I never properly learned how to really communicate. I'm always so anxious around people. Scared of the fact that they, too, can think and might judge me or something...? I can't pin it down exactly, but I'm definitely scared of interacting with people I'm not really close with. Hell, I'm even scared of talking to my own mother.   

The only people I can really talk with are my friends. I love them a lot, especially recently – this sounds super egoistic, I'm sorry – since they kinda started to become aware that I'm not well? Maybe? I don't know.. They started to tell me that they like me and appreciate me, which I didn't know I was missing. I know that they care about me, but.... I feel like crap saying this, but I still feel lonely and don't know why. I love my friends and don't want to worry them, I don't want to be a burden to them. Which is why I am writing this here, instead of talking to someone. I feel like a nuisance, a waste of space, useless and stupid. I hate myself. For being anxious, awkward, a hermit and inconsiderate of the feelings of others.   

Sometimes I question my capability of feeling emotions. I can't tell if I actually love the people around me. I know that I appreciate them, yes, but if our paths were to no longer cross, I could forget them in less than two weeks. Which has happened before. And I hate that. It makes me hate myself even more.

Day by day, I escape reality. I'm glad I hate alcohol, or I'd probably be an alcoholic or something... Instead, I drown myself in fiction. Day-dreams. The lives of others. Even different cultures. I remember so much about fictional worlds, characters, worlds I made up myself, my favourite musicians (whose music is basically what's keeping me sane sometimes)... Yet I barely remember what I did the last week. 

I'm unimportant and untalented anyway, I wish I could just disappear already. I'm scared of dying though, so even if suicide was a good solution, I couldn't do it. I want to start over. In a different country maybe. In a different family. A different social environment. Even though I would miss (most of) the people around me... But that's impossible anyway. So I just have to somehow continue with this life, in this godforsaken body, as myself, I guess. Even if I don't want to.

I want to be honest, I'm not expecting any advice. I considered all possible solutions I could think of. Even therapy, which is just simply too expensive for someone who can't even afford a haircut right now.... 

Maybe I'm just an attention-seeker and my life isn't that bad, I don't know how others see it, but I feel like crap and alone.. I would still be grateful for anything.

Thank you for making it this far, I hope you have a wonderful day.","You seem like a very vulnerable person. I have pretty much in common with you and...

g8eq07,foonirf,"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.

g881uq,fom7k6b,Am I subhuman?," 

I (a M17 for anyone who cares) have been in a tough and confusing place emotionally for most of my life and I have had no one to talk about it. I have friends but I don't think they would give me much advice. I can't talk to my parents because my Dad just thinks that my life is the best that there could and that I am stupid to say other wise and my Mom thinks just touching a computer will give you depression. So I am turning here as I am tired of not being listened to or taken seriously.

Also so you know I am posting this to multiple subreddits to see responses from different communities, just fyi.

So with that out of the way, here is my life story for anyone who cares to try and make sense of it:

I started out life through preschool pretty good and loved. My Mom was a teacher before having me and had a lot of learning material lying about the house when I was young. I being young was interested and asked my Mom to read them to me until I learned to read. Then I just read them my self. I grew a passion for science especially anything about space, and physics at a really young age. I was told that I was really intelligent from a young age although I never believed it. I had no friends my age to tell me other wise. I still don't believe it sometimes.

I am not telling you this to brag about me being a genius or a child prodigy or anything stupid like that. Because I am not a genius or smart or anything I am just highly interested in things most people my age aren't. I am telling you this so that you know that I had it good starting off but things off. In fact this is the only time in my life that I remember ever feeling happy or human.

Things began to change as soon as kindergarten began. Around this time my mother started having serious migraines and vertigo and dizziness. This plus some other health issues she had from before I was born meant that she was in pain and nausea most of the time and could almost never leave the house.

At first I tried everything I could to help her but she started to become increasingly volatile. She began to blow up at everything and just became generally emotionally abusive. Due to this I grow to hate her. This continued for most of my life up until recently. I don't hate her now and I still love her as my Mom but at the time this was not the case.

Then also at the same time I realized that I was just socially incapable and still am. Almost every time I tried to talk to anyone I usually just ended up being laughed at or got concerned/irritated looks from everyone. It seemed any time I tried to interact with anyone I'd just get embarrassed. I grew to hate my self and felt subhuman. I ended up closing myself off from everyone until 8th grade.

Then in first grade I made a friend although to this day I am still unsure if he was a friend or something else. But he was my only friend and he ended up being almost a brother to me. Although I don't know if he thought that.

But then he one day introduced me to one of his friends who I shall call Potato Head or PH for short because I hate him. He would always pull jokes and made it a point to show everyone how dumb I was and how smart he was. To this day I still don't know if it was bullying or if he was trying to be a friend and was just teasing me. I hate being gaslighted, if I was gaslighted? And maybe I am gaslighting my self about being gaslighted, who knows?

Worse part was that my friend would go along with PH in his jokes although after PH was gone he would say he was sorry just to do it again later. But as they were my only ""friends"" I stuck with them until middle school.

All of this continued to eat away at me and make me feel subhuman and still does. This even got so bad that in 5th grade I started provoking PH to start beating me up just to feel something other than self hatred. I came home from school every day with bruises and scars.

Eventually I got away from PH and made a couple of new friends that have shown me what friendship is really like.

But there is still more. In high school I got sick before school started in the summer and missed the entire first week of school. After I came back I became so overwhelmed between the work I had and social anxiety that I start lying about being sick to everyone just to avoid going to school. Then the school put me on a program were a teacher would bring me school work from school and I had to teach myself everything. Only problem was that some of the teachers just didn't give me the work sometimes but still counted off for it. Due to this I failed a couple classes which crushed me emotionally as I had never failed a class before or had gotten bad grades in anything before.

I am a terrible human being and I hate myself for lying and doing.

After that year I tried to open up more and to generally fix my life but, now this quarantine and some procrastination has made me super behind in multiple classes which has forced me to push every one away again.

If anyone can help me out and make sense of my life I thank you. I have recently attempted suicide and I need help. I can't talk to anyone for fear of being a fool. I lied about being sick for a year. I have no one to talk to. Am I subhuman?","No, you’re just human everyone has their flaws. Honestly most high iq students actually suffer from this slow burn making them suffer from low self esteem, horrible effort when it comes to school later and just horrible all around luck.

I suffer from anti social personality disorder and I am a low spectrum sociopath I suffer from fits of callousness that reaches a point I’ve almost killed someone. You will be alright because you can push farther than anyone, a smart teenager who only suffers from these things because he’s scared your fear is ok especially at this early age (I’m 21) I know how it feels it’s time you just slowly try to understand your identity.",2,2,0

How  do you fix your life after it's mostly your fault that you are in this  position. I've had a lot of time the last year to reflect on my life;  all the good...all the bad. Every night I lay in bed just reflecting on  moments in my life that put me into the position im in right now, it  makes me suicidal something I think about doing every few days and still  dont know why I haven't ended it.

(I am currently 21 years old)

There  is no fixing my issue I ruined years of friendship over love. I fell  for a beautiful chick my first 2 years of UNI; such a smart and  beautiful personality, I really thought she was **the one**  but so is the irony of this opinion. My best friend (ex) would warn me  about how she was using me for her own benefits but you are all fimiliar  with how blinded some can get when they are in love, truly leading to  their own demise. I changed as a person so much because of her; working  out and getting in perfect shape but also ruining my personality  completely turning my friends for life off.

The  irony is my best friend was right, she was using me. It went down hill  the final moments and I embarrassed myself my getting shit hammered  drunk and face timing her on 2019 New Years Eve like a fucking moron and  that was it.

I got into a massive  argument with my best friend Benny (ill give him that name here) and we  didnt speak for a whole year. In betwenn that time my years of  depression kicked in, I made horrible mistakes in my life; killing my  dreams of medical school as I failed multiple classes in UNI ; losing my  virginity to a random tinder slut which ruined my friendship with my  other close friends as well.

During  the 2020 covid lockdown and online Uni classes I really became a ghost,  I vanished. My friends would message me on snapchat or IG but I would  take weeks to reply as I was mentally battling my demons, trying to keep  myself from blowing my brains out. I became such a ghost I lost  contanct with everyone, only talking to 1 last friends over music and  reaching out to my best friend Benny only because I was a drunken  diasterous, apoligizing for all the shit I caused to him because of  blinded love.

It's  June 27th 2021 2:57 am; I have lost literally all contact with my life  long friends as I devolped as habit of not replying to messages for  weeks. I cheated through online UNI classes because it was my only hope  left of staying afloat academically. I failed, it's over for me, there  is no recovery from this a trust end to ends. I hope for those of you  who have struggled with depression for years... I hope you have good  things come to you in your near future, do not fuck your life up like I  did to myself. I dont think I can ever fix my friendships as it's been  so long since I spoke to anyone. I even had a long time best friend  reach out to me to go to his birthday party but I took a whole week to  even get the courage to open his message and I still didnt open his  message after replying back. I've fucked up and I dont know how much  longer I can go through this; the only thing keeping me from killing  myself is my loving mother, brother, and father. I cant imagine the  eternal suffering I would put on them if I blew my brains out. It's the  only thing that has kept me alive for years of suffering from  depression.

I  will never understand how God created such perfect creatures;  beautiful, intelligence, and powerful yet most of us will suffer while  the few cherish a full fulling life. Goodnight and goodbye. I know  nobody will read this nor care, im used to it now. I hope those of you  who are also mentally suffering have a good life ahead.","I know what I’m suggesting will be hard, but can you reach out to all of them?

k96240,gf2gk1k,"TW // SA Assaulted by my dad when I was around 12, have to act like nothing happened","Hi i don't really know how to use reddit and my writing is really messy but pls bear with me. a few days ago my dad admitted to assaulting me while i was asleep in my parents bed, but in his defence he was also asleep while he did it( i wont go into further detail, I don't want to think about it). He said it was the reason I had to stop sleeping in my parents room, meaning I had to be 12 at the time, and he was talking about it as if it were a fond memory, clearly not taking it as seriously as he should be. My mom was in the room when he said this, and told him off for it, but nothing more. Ever since then I've not been able to look my dad in the eye and tried to avoid him as much as possible; I've tried to just ignore what had happened but it's all I've been thinking about, distracting myself doesn't work, since I'm on semester break and have nothing to do all day. It's hard to even get out of bed and I've been crying myself to sleep since. My parents act as if nothing has happened and I've been spending most of my days in my room. It's made me reflect on times when my dad would call me out for sitting indecently in the house, even when nobody's around; once he said I looked like a pornstar because I was lying on the bed with my legs standing and torso on the bed and wearing shorts. I was 15 at the time i think.

Today my mom asked me to make a slideshow for my dad since his birthday is coming soon. I thought she'd be more understanding of my situation but I clearly thought wrong. She then proceeded to show  me photo albums with my dad's pictures to use in the slideshow and happily presented it to me as my project this semester break. She even asked me if I was happy now that i have something to do because she hates when I don't do anything around the house. 

My parents have always been emotionally absent so I'm not sure what I expected from them, but the littlest bit of remorse from my dad and some empathy from my mom is all I ask for. It's only been getting more and more difficult these past few days and I truly feel at rock bottom. I don't know what to do and I can't leave home because I still want to pursue a higher education, which I can only do with my parents' financial help. Please give me advice on how to deal with this.","You say that he was ""asleep"" when he did this? As in a ""sleepwalking"" type of incident? I'd that's true, perhaps he was on sleep medication at the time. I know meds like Ambien can make people do CRAZY things. I used to work with a guy who told me about his experience with Ambien. He took his medicine and went to bed, then he woke up in a jail cell. He remembers absolutely NOTHING else. Turns out that he was ""sleepwalking"" and ended up leaving his house, driving his truck and then crashed it in a ditch. According to the police, they pulled up on him in his pajamas and boots, trying to lift his truck up out of the ditch like he was the hulk or something. �� They arrested him for DWI even though he didn't have a drop of alcohol in his system.

kng0cc,ghk8r5g,Depression teeth,"I need somewhere to talk about this and I don't really have any close friends or anyone I trust not to make fun of me for this. But I'm 24, and I've struggled on and off with depression since I was a teenager. One thing that was/is hard for me when I'm feeling down is taking care of my health and hygiene, gross I know. I've gotten a bit better in the second half of 2020 but when it comes to my teeth, a lot of damage has already been done. 

I haven't been to a dentist since 2018 (after coming out of a long depression, go figure), I got some cavities filled and a root canal. My habits had gotten so bad I honestly forgot brushing your tongue was a thing. They were very concerned about my tongue but luckily it was fine, just the multiple cavities and tooth that needed a root canal. Since the root canal and crown I've not been back to any dentist, and after the shit show that was 2020, struggling again with depression 2019/2020, the fog has started to lift a bit, and I realize I've really hurt myself these past couple years. I have so much pain in my mouth some days, that I finally scheduled an appointment with a dentist who accepts my insurance and is accepting new patients (took a while to find one) but they're scheduling out to mid February, so I've got to just suck it up for the next month and a half.

mja6jy,gtbi62u,"today i asked my mom why she never did anything to stop my oldest sister from sexually and physically abusing me when i was younger. she said ""every person experiences something bad, no one has had a perfect life."" (TW: sexual and physical abuse; child neglect)","edit: thank you so much guys, i am overwhelmed with love. i realized that there are people out there that care about me, i care about you too. in fact, strangers on the internet seem kinder than anyone i have ever met. if you are in an abusive household, please stay strong and try your best to defend yourself (i carry around pepper spray all the time in case something happens). please stay safe. i love you. i am deciding to stay here, i am not giving up now.

backstory: throughout the ages of 7-10 my sister was physically and sexually violent towards me. she used to cut me in my pubic area, till i was bleeding for days. shed hit me almost every day and she would tell me i am useless (etc...). whenever i told my mom about the things she did, she never tried helping me. throughout the years, i asked her why she never stopped it, she called me a liar at times, but also said she doesnt recall any of it happening

due to being stuck at home (lockdown), these memories came back up, and i realized that it was child abuse. i am 16 years old now. i have been seeing a therapist eversince i was 12 because i once 'tried' to commit suicide.

today my mother asked me if i am getting my sister anything for her birthday, i said no, and my mother asked me why im not going to do that. i told her that i do not support an abuser, and then i brought up the cutting that she did. and i asked her once again why she never did anything about it. she stayed silent this time, but said she was going to ask my sister about it because she doesnt remember it.

i am at my lowest, i am afraid that my sister is going to get violent towards me once again, if my mom asks her. my sister still lives with us.","I would question first your decision if you choose so to contact the authorities.  Some people call the police first, like the viral story about a middle-age white woman calling the police on a black elementary school student selling water.  I believe in resorting to the police last.  Not just because it could ruin your sister’s life and flip your family upside down, but the effect it will have on you.  You will be dragged through court by the prosecutor, your mom might cut you off financially as they try to save your sister legally, and the trauma as well as the vacuum of time and energy which is the cost of using the legal system. 

The priority should be in LEAVING and CUTTING OFF CONTACT. Unless your sister is mentally ill, she is old enough to know that is wrong.

I was sexually abused and assaulted by my parents and brother (in turn I never assaulted or abused them).  However, it was a grand sum of about 50-100 times, not systematic and daily reality of abuse lasting years. I never been in that situation I wouldn’t know.

For me, my mom molested me a handful of times, the rest was violent assault split about evenly.  I was chronically ill and vulnerable, had become a freak.  It is a psychological phenomena of families turning on a chronically ill member to chronically abuse them.  

My mom punched me on a pressure point on my throat that immediately had me on the floor chocking.  She stimulated or injured my genitals one degree removed e.g. blow dry my crotch, pulling the waistband of my jeans so the crotch crushed my testicles, etc. my dad once tackled me and proceeded to strangle by the throat. 

I still talk to them. It’s definitely not close like it was when I was a young child. But love to me is a deep sea of forgiveness and affection. It’s not infinite and ties can be estranged, but what happened to me wasn’t enough for me to betray my loyalty. I would never call the police and get them in legal trouble, rather I would talk it out, or forgive and forget while punishing via withdrawing my contact with them. And so on. Family is supposed to be a safe haven from the rest of the world where you all look out for and support each other. Not even the law comes before the loyalty and love of a functional family.  Ideally. 

It’s your decision. I hope my experience helps with your perspective. I know how it feels despite mine not being as bad.  I know the pain and loneliness. The envy that burns whenever you encounter a functional loving family.  Use it as fuel to make your life more beautiful; compensate by focusing on making your own life successful.

I love you.  I will think about you and send good vibes.  Be strong.  Find a girlfriend that will shower you with the love, affection, friendly touch, etc. that your family deprived you of.",2,2,0

idtzwh,g2dvfcd,I don't know what to feel,"It's not super serious but I feel like I should add a TW for possible sexual assault? Nothing graphic or too serious though.

This happened awhile ago before covid and all that.

I had this friend who I knew was kind of an asshole, but he was also funny and has helped me in the past.

One day he asked if I wanted to hang out. it was late and I had taken a nap prior to us making plans to hang out because I had finals so I was still tired. This was around 9pm. We went out to eat and then he asked where I wanted to go after and I suggested a mall. 

He said ok and drove to where the location was but then took a turn to a more secluded area near the ocean. At this time it was around 10pm and pitch black out. I instantly felt uncomfortable and was like, ""what are we doing. Lets just go to the mall haha.""

He kept saying, ""nah. It's fine, I just want to take a nap."" At that point all I wanted to do was go home and I felt VERY uncomfortable because it was obviously a hook up spot.

So he stopped in a parking lot near the ocean-- there was one other car and they were obviously  hooking up. He went to the back of his car and laid down but was mostly on his phone.

I kept asking if we could just go home and at that point I know I should have put my foot down and demanded we go home or told him I was uncomfortable with all of it. But I didn't.

Instead he ended up climbing back into the drivers seat and then asked me to kiss him. I said no. He said, ""I just want you to make out with me to see how it'd be. Aren't you curious?"" 

I said no, because I was not interested in him romantically and I had told him that multiple times.

He kept insisting and tried to straddle me a few times but I would push him off and laugh it off even though I hated it and felt extremely uncomfortable.

At this point I should have put my foot down and said, ""no. Take me home."" But I didn't. 

At that time I wondered why I didn't. Then I realized it was because I was scared of rocking the boat, making it more awkward or upsetting him. I was scared.

He kept insisting I make out him, and I kept trying to compromise with him saying I'll kiss his cheek but I insisted that I wasn't going to make out him.

He ended up saying that I either make out with him or pay him $30 for gas for driving us. He had been the one to ask me to hang out and when I said I was tired he kept insisting and then brought me to a place I didn't want to go to.

When I said I just wanted to leave and go home, he kept saying, ""I'm not forcing you to stay here. You can get out of the car and go find another ride."" We were at a secluded area, it was pitch black at 10pm and people were hooking up around us.

After a bit he started scrolling on his phone and said he was going to make an ""appointment"" then. In other words find a hook up. He then continued to show me the nudes of these girls on snapchat-- which he took videos of with his other phone (he videotaped the nudes that were sent through snapchat so he didn't have to screenshot them and it wouldn't tell them he screenshotted it).

At that point I felt disgusted and VERY uncomfortable. All I wanted at this point was to go home. 

He asked me to make out a few more times before I finally cracked and said I'd pay him.

He switched the flip and said no, that he just wanted to make out or else we'd continue to sit in the parking lot.

I kept saying no, that I'd send him $30 because I just wanted to go home. He made me send him the e-transfer before we left the parking lot. He dropped me off maybe a block away from my house and drove off.

I blocked him on everything after that.

At the time I didn't think he'd rape me, but at the same time I didn't expect him to trap me in his car far away from my home at 10pm during winter and try to force me to make out with him, so i suppose I didn't actually know.

I should have seen this coming or at least have seen the red flags. There were other things he did that crossed a lot of lines and where I said I was uncomfortable with something he was doing or did and he did it anyway/continued.

I should have known. Sometimes I hate how scared I was to confront him, to stand my ground. I wish I did. I wish I told him what he was doing made me uncomfortable and scared me.

At first I didn't think about it much and I thought about it every now and then but when it popped up in my mind I would just push it back out. 

I ended up typing it out ready to send it to a friend and I started crying. I don't even know why I cried. I mean it's not like he raped me or physically forced himself on me. he didn't hurt me.

I've only ever told 3 of my friends about it.

I'm not too sure how I feel about it. I don't think I'm traumatized by that. This is the first time I thought about it in a while and I haven't cried either time than that one time. 

I don't have panic attacks about it or feel scared when I'm in a car alone with a guy in the dark.

I ended up driving past the area we were parked and it reminded me of the event. I wasn't scared or sad. I felt mad.

I do know one thing for sure. I hate him.

I don't think I've ever hated someone the way I hate him. I've always looked at the bigger picture and tried to reason and look on their side as to why they acted the way they did. 

His excuse when i asked him why he kept insisting? I leaned back in my chair and I was chewing gum-- all signs that I wanted to make out with him. Wrong.

n3x6ds,gwu0mfd,My mom died because of the virus,"She died on Orthodox Easter day. She was 47, and her birthday would have been today, May 3rd. I am only 19 and I am shocked. I also have a sister that just turned 17 and she's also in a bad state. My father is trying to look tough but he can't hold his tears.

She was the best. My sunshine. My hope. My light everyday when I woke up. She always supported me through everything. Whenever I felt sad, she was there. Yes, there have been some fights here and there, disagreements, but we always loved her. I am so sad I never got to tell her I am sorry for so many things. I am sorry that college took so much of my free time that we haven't been talking a lot lately. She was thinking that I was mad at her but what I actually was doing is study, as she always told me. She always wanted me to learn to become someone I am proud of.

I can't stop but think how she died. On April 27, everything was great, we were celebrating my sister's birthday and she was smiling and eating cake with us. That night, she had some bad coughs but she didn't really think much about it. We didn't either. That night she couldn't sleep. Second night, it was worse, to the point she couldn't breathe properly and was unconscious. We called the ambulance after we noticed she was being unconscious. I am blaming myself for not calling it earlier. I could have saved her. I feel like a monster and responsible for this. Shortly after the ambulance came, they put a face mask on her so she could breath and I saw her and I waved at her. I was crying. That's when I found out she had COVID. 

She went to the hospital and that day I was very nervous. I got the information that only a miracle could save her as 66% of her lungs were affected. She had very small % of oxygen saturation when she left. She managed to recover a bit as her saturation went up to 75% and then 90%. I thought that she was feeling much better. I even got to see her a bit and motivate her to fight with this virus. She was so happy to se nue me. I got to touch her hand again. She was so optimistic. The next day, day before Easter, she even wanted to talk with us on Whatsapp as she was feeling good to do so. She wasn't able to talk that much though. I thought that was a good signal that she was recovering. On Orthodox Easter Day, May 2, She suffered cardio-respirstory arrest and died. She died optimistic that she would get home and show us all the gifts she got us for Easter. 

Today, I opened the gifts she got us and I feel so bad. She cared about us so much. She was so good at heart. I don't know why God took her so early. She definitely wanted to stay and please us with her happiness. I feel like this world just isn't right. I feel like I lost a huge part of me and I have a very hard time dealing with this. I am even steering school tommorow from holiday and I have no motivation. Actually, my only motivation is her, as she always wanted me to study and become someone big. I want to make her proud. I am sad we won't be celebrating my birthday this year as we used to. She was always stressing about birthdays as she wanted everything to be perfect.

I don't know what to do. I am still very young and I feel lost. I feel like nothing is right and I just want to be with her. I want to feel her hands again. Her laugh. Her smile. Her everything. She was my everything. Even when we talked on Whatsapp, she had the ability to wish me ""Happy Easter"". It wasn't happy mom, I lost you. I miss you.

k7gp3f,geqxyt2,Advice needed for someone struggling with depression and low self-esteem,"Hi, thank you for clicking on my post and taking the time to read it. I apologise that it’s quite long and a bit all over the place (that’s how my head feels right now), but I’ll try and get everything down that may be relevant. I’m 27 years old (almost 28) and I was diagnosed with depression in February/March this year. I’ve been on anti-depressants since then, started off with sertraline but then moved to citalopram after having issues with restlessness and lack of sleep. I’ve also been having psychoanalytical therapy sessions every week since March/April. Now, I have made significant progress since then, I had a period of about 3/4 months during lockdown where I cried a lot every day while also having a lot of intrusive suicidal thoughts, I’d find myself staring at knives and just generally thinking about wanting to no longer exist because I couldn’t see my life getting better. I honestly think I’d never actually do it because I wouldn’t want to hurt my parents and my friends.

Last year I proposed to my ex and we planned to get married in 2020, we had been going out for 2 years and neither of us were planning to get married anytime soon but due to visa reasons we thought this was an easy way to continue being together. We both loved each other, however we ended up breaking up over Christmas. She was my first girlfriend and the only person I’ve had sexual relations with. She was the only person I’ve truly felt comfortable around as she made it clear she loved me how I was and never pressured me to lose weight. She made me feel loved which was probably what made it so hard. Other than that towards the end of the relationship it got really bad and we would argue a lot. She had major issues with my mom and they would clash on occasions, leaving me in really uncomfortable positions (she even thought my mom was lying about surgery she needed just to get my attention). The relationship got really unhealthy over the last year but I think my fear of never finding love made me want to keep trying and to make it work. I’ve always worried about having relationships because girls never seemed interested in me, even after going to university for 4 years, while all my friends were pulling on nights out and having sexual relations I didn’t. I put it down to my weight and looks, despite my mates reassuring me that I wasn’t ugly and that I would find love (thats what good mates would say right?) A lot of my friends after the break up were saying she treated me badly and I’d be better off without her but didn’t want to say anything because I seemed happy and it would be very awkward to intrude (even more so with a wedding seemingly on the way). She would often keep going over the same thing, getting annoyed easily about things and taking stuff out on me even if I did nothing wrong. Don’t get me wrong I wasn’t the perfect boyfriend, but I felt like I did try a lot. I very rarely shouted back or got heavily involved in arguments, most of the time I would prefer to take myself away from the situation if it was boiling over, something which would annoy her more. Although I am noticing that I can get angry now over pretty much nothing, something which I’ve discussed with my therapist but haven’t quite come to a solution. These anger management problems are something I’ve only really had an issue with over the past year and a half.
I’ve also always been overweight all my life, I’m one of those people who will go through periods of losing weight and putting it back on later down the line. I would quite often vary from overweight to obese on the BMI scale. Despite being sporty and continuing to play in competitive sports all my life, my main issue is  with eating fast food when I feel down. It almost feels a bit like self sabotage, like I don’t deserve to be happy for some reason. I’ve always been quite insecure with low self-esteem, I put it down to being picked on for how I looked at school (fat kid with glasses) and in my football team when I was younger. I would hate being centre of attention and would try my best to not stand out to avoid unwanted comments. I see myself as someone who is unattractive, and because of this I have this fear that I’ll die alone. My therapist and I focus a lot on my pessimism about finding love and also fear of rejection (which I think is justified because who would say yes?). 

My therapy has been useful in some ways, I know more about why I am the way I am, and some of the things that happened to me as a child which has shaped how I act and react to things as an adult. Although, I’m not completely sure this type of talk therapy is right for me. I do trust my therapist and she does make me feel comfortable, but being someone who doesn’t like to be the centre of attention, I get uncomfortable at the idea of talking on a video call for 50 minutes, where I can see my own face on screen. Maybe it would be better in person but unfortunately covid has made that impossible. The sessions will begin and sometimes I don’t know what to talk about, and I feel like I’m just going over the same things without actually getting solutions. Sometimes I wonder whether a different type of therapy where I’m given a bit more direction and the therapist can give me a bit of a push, instead of giving me the space and time to get things off my chest (don’t get me wrong this is useful when I’m stressed and have a lot on my plate).

Like I said before, my depression is definitely improving, as in my down days are less regular, and my suicidal ideation isn’t as intrusive as it used to be, but I still have this feeling of hopelessness, like I’ll never be truly happy. Despite feeling a bit unfulfilled at university, I made some incredible memories and friends for life. It feels a bit like my life peaked then and it’s all going to be downhill from there.

I have a lot of things to be thankful for, like my health, my family, my friends and my career. But in my eyes a loveless life is a life not worth living. I have a lot of close friends but the majority of them are in relationships, and I’ve almost started to get feelings of jealousy and resentment towards them. I spend a lot of time feeling sorry for myself and feeling like I haven’t deserved this, but can also understand why people would look at me and think why doesn’t he just lose weight and then I’d have more of a chance with women. I ask myself the same question.

Thanks again for reading. I’m mainly looking for some comfort, advice on therapy and anything else to do with depression and low self-esteem. If you want to know more about me feel free to ask.

Edit: forgot to mention my age","Man the way it sounds you are the kind of man that many of my female friends are looking for. Yes looks matter but not as much. If you asked any girl that's worth talking to the only reason they might reject you is because they don't know you. I've asked my friends and I knew their answer was genuine because I am fairly fit so they couldn't connect me with that but they say that even if you are fat (, which I hate saying cause that's an awful word) they wouldn't care. What matters is your attitude towards those around. 
And those mates of yours just sound like the best kind of mates. The best advice I can give you is to concentrate on the little things that make you happy and another thing is to make peace with your ex. Even if you ended breaking up I am sure you have amazing memories with her and have both learn the value of the other after the break up. Staying in touch even if just from time to time just to ask how are things is enough to help stop feeling down. Then you'd be in peace with yourself.

j1oxj4,g710hew,I don’t like the taste of alcohol," I was a super goody two shoes kind of kid; I didn’t so much as touch alcohol until I was 18 and went to college. Since then, it’s always tasted super gross to me. I don’t know if it’s because I started late or have some kind of genetic defect but I’ve never been able to acquire the burning taste. 

If I’m with other people, I’ll occasionally order a drink for the sake of having a drink but then I have to try really hard to not make faces when I take sips. Cocktails and wine are a struggle because I can still taste the burn. When I was “underage,” drinking was fun and exciting but now that I’m a real adult, I don’t really find it enjoyable. Other people talk about how much they love having a glass of wine at the end of a long day but that’s, frankly, the last thing I want to do. Similarly, quarantine style day drinking just makes me sleepy. 

Does anyone else fall into this camp? I always feel super weird turning down alcohol; most of the people I know who don’t drink are “holier than thou” assholes or are otherwise really weird about it.

And now I have and I do every day. And it's concrete in my mind; I WILL die no matter what and nothing will stop me. That is, if they put her down.

Last year I was in jail for 3 months. I had a close friend I've known since I was 9 watch my dogs during that time. One is mine, and one is my boyfriend's, who was in jail for a year last year. My dog is the sweetest thing I've ever met in my life. I've had a lot of dogs, but never before had I had a connection to a dog like I do with her. I've had her since she was 8 weeks old and she's like my child. She's my everything. Well, two days before I got out of jail, apparently my friend accidentally let the dogs escape and they got picked up by animal services. They wouldn't give them back to me. They said it would be dealt with in court. My court date was supposed to be March 25. Then the coronavirus thing happened and court was shut down and no one could tell me when or if the court date would be rescheduled for. So I'm not saying I did it, but I got arrested for an attempted burglary for apparently trying to get her out. I have court for that next month. My court date for the dogs still hasn't been rescheduled, and now I've hired a lawyer for the dog thing, and my lawyer is telling me they haven't rescheduled because now they're taking it even further and saying since I can't make good decisions regarding them, they're going to have them taken from me and destroyed. I haven't seen my Babygirl for 9 months now. And my lawyer said it doesn't look good for us.

I can't live in a world where my government takes my baby from me and murders her, for no real reason other than they don't like me. I treat my dogs like equal members of my family... They are so spoiled and so well taken care of.... Anyways, I can't and I don't want to and I won't so sometime in the next few months after they finally make the decision, I'm going to kill myself. It's just hard, every day I can't think of anything but dying. I miss her so much... Instead of it getting easier my heart just breaks more every day and I'm in too much pain.

o7dff5,h2zvhnv,I think I am starting to resent my race,"I am a white man living in the southern United States who is heavily involved in the black community. My fiancé is black and the majority of my friend group for the last few years have been black people. There is no particular reason for this, it's just the way my life has went recently.

And because of this, I have seen all the ways that white people look at black people differently. The ways they treat them differently. Even if white people aren't overtly racist, the subtle prejudice is there. The suspicion and fear. White people only like black people who act exactly like they do.

There have been several occasions that black women have confessed to me that they usually feel uncomfortable around white men, but they feel very comfortable around me. My girlfriend's family has referred to me as ""not really white"" and this isn't because I act black (I don't) but because I am genuinely comfortable around black people and don't have many of the negative tendencies that are associated with white people. And this is so sad to me, that the way I act is just so out of the norm. I wish everybody could just see each other with genuine love and kindness, not fake love hidden behind prejudices.

Not to mention the police violence that gets broadcasted. It also disgusts me how the political powers pander to the black community just for their vote, it seems that nobody actually cares about the Black community.

It’s had such a mental toll on me where I feel like I can’t even have a relationship of my own because she would feel so shit about it. I’ve tried to get therapy for her but it’s near impossible due to COVID and when we did get her temporary help she didn’t want to get better.

I’ve told her school but there isn’t much they can do about it, her family is awful and not supportive of her at all but she can’t leave them. She doesn’t really have friends and doesn’t want to make any because her trust issues have gotten so bad.

I’ve also tried suicide lines but they can’t do anything because she’s not in any immediate danger. And whenever I get her to call them she doesn’t want to because she says she can’t open up to anyone on the phone.

She says the only reason why she’s still alive today is because of me, but sometimes wishes I wasn’t her friend so that she could kill herself.

I want to be there for her but it’s really weighed me down mentally, always having to be there for her when she’s crying, staying up late, having to prioritise her so she does get sad.

She knows she’s obsessed with me and that she is low-key toxic yet feels she can’t do anything about it and gets extremely jealous whenever I do anything outside of her. Every little thing I say she always sees negative and then gets upset over and I always feel like I’m walking under eggshells.

I just feel like I can’t do anything with my life and that I can’t get anyone to help her because she doesn’t let anyone in. I’ve tried so much to help her and give her as much advice as possible but she juss doesn’t want to get any better.

The worst thing about it is, that I KNOW that I’m the only person she truly cares about and that if I do leave she WILL kill herself (or at least attempt to) and I really don’t want her to do that. I’d rather go through what I’m going through than her commuting suicide so I’m just so stuck.


Please help me.

(EDIT: just a little bit of background so you have some context.

I turned 19 in September and she will be turning 18 in February. I know her from school and we have been good friends before all of this.

ka42xg,gf86jxo,I think I’m still in love with her,"Typing from mobile. Sorry for the long story. 


It’s been over 9 months and I can’t seem to stop thinking about my (ex)best friend that’s also someone I think I truly loved. To make matters worse, I’m with my girl of over 6 years still and have a baby on the way. 

I met her(best friend)as a freshman in high school and we’ve  been best friends since. However in high school we tried to be a couple but it just didn’t work so we left that alone. Even though we didn’t work as a couple I seemed to have very strong feelings for her as the years went by. She moved back to her hometown (NYC) after high school and we fell off. About 5-6 years later years later she send me a DM asking how I’m doing. I got extremely excited of the dm and that’s when the butterflies kicked in super hard. 

I told my girlfriend of 3 years at the time knew of her, so when she saw another girls name on my phone it didn’t bother her. It also didn’t bother her because my friend was lesbian now. (She always had gay tendencies). Me and my best friend messaged and talked/FaceTimed almost every day for about 2 years and the more we spoke the more my feeling became stronger. I was starting to fall in love with her.... AGAIN...

Once day me and the BF were talking and that’s when she told me something I wished she never told me... That she was started to have feeling for me again also. But that feeling was love.. I was stunned.. My heart sank, my gut tighten, my whole entire body seemed to have disconnected but my heart and mind exploded with a euphoria I had not felt in years. I tried to speak but my stuttering mouth couldn’t muster up the words that I wanted to say since I was a kid. “I love you too”. 

As much I wanted to be with her we couldn’t. I lived with my GF and it wasn’t right to just leave her. My BF understood considering she was in a relationship also with her girlfriend of 3 years. I feel like us being in a relationship made this forbidden love so much more interesting and exciting but again we knew we couldn’t be together not even putting our location in the equation. However I would’ve moved close for her in a heartbeat. 

Another year rolls by and then 2020 hits, we say how this year has been sucking and how it should reset. We speak of the plans we had for our birthdays and how we won’t be able to do Any thing because of Covid. Her birthday is mid April and she wanted to go Miami but that fell off so I ask her for her address so I can send her something she does the same because mines the same month. I give her my sisters address because I don’t trust sending anything to my apartments. (I lived in a bit so great area). My sister calls me saying my package came in early and for me to get it. It was early in the morning and I rush to her place to pick it up before she goes to work. I knock on her door and she says in the guest room. I jog over to her guest room wondering what it could be. I swing open the door to have the most amazing present staring at me. My BF. 

We embrace each other with so much emotion and we can’t help but to kiss each other at that moment. At this moment I knew what I really wanted. She was with me for 3 days and for those 3 days my girlfriend didn’t know she was in town I also told her I was hanging out with my brother that was visiting from out of town. Yes. Me and her were intimately every way. Everything we wanted to do with each other we did. Those 3 days were some of best days of my life and I will never forget them. 

She finally has to leave back to New York and I watching her leave broke my fucken heart. A month rolls by and my girlfriend noticed me acting different. I just told her she was trippin and being weird. One morning I was awoken by her shaking me violently asking why I cheated on her. I denied everything thinking I deleted all the evidence. Apparently iPhone likes to keep deleted pics just in case you accidentally delete one. On of those picture was me and my BF kissing that she took. I didn’t have anything to say so I admitted to the actions. She broke up with me and kicked me out and told me to get my stuff when she wasn’t home. 

Yes I felt guilty but do I regret it? No. I saw this as a sign. I was finally able to be with the person I though I was suppose to be with. I told my BF about what happened and she broke up with her GF that same day. We made plans about moving in together soon to start our lives together. I missed her so I decided to go to NYC and see her. I was there for 4 days and I was great. I came back home thinking my life was going great. 

One day she send me a message out of no where saying she needs to disappear from the world for a bit. That meant no social media or phone. I got confused and asked how are we suppose to communicate? She responded with that she need to get away from me. Me hoping not to lose her I agreed to letting her have her time to herself. I even said I’ll be waiting for her when she’s ready. “Don’t wait on me. I don’t want to hold you back from anything.” I have the same reaction when she told me she loved me for the first time but this time I felt pain. Damn near felt like physical pain. I tried and suggested everything to keep her in my life but nothing worked. We said our goodbyes and that was it. 

After about 3 weeks I was still single but going on dates. A friend of mine asked if I spoke to my ex GF that I was with for 5 years lately I said no. Her dad apparently had diagnosed with cancer. I was close to her dad so I sent her a message asking if her dad was ok. She said yes and we texted back and forth for a bit. She then asked me if I wanted to grab some liquor and drink a bit at her apartment. I agreed. We drank we slept together and started talking/dating again. A month and half into talking I find out she’s pregnant. I told her for us to work things out and get together and attempt this relationship again. And now we are happy and she’s not that far from giving birth. But I think about my best friend still till this day. Our first ultrasound we had all I thought was how I wanted my BF to be in her shoes. Yes I know it’s messed up but my feeling have changed.

P.S SD- San Diego, California.","Restaurants should be open just not for dine-in options. People are losing their jobs left and right and there is no government assistance in place. I disagree that everything needs to be shut down. Good to know you’re a healthcare worker but the rest of us not in healthcare have lost our jobs or have reduced hours and can’t even make a living let alone pay our bills so a vast majority are being told to stay at home with NO ASSISTANCE. What do you think people should do when they are losing their jobs? What is your suggestion? Sitting at home on lockdown doesn’t pay my bills.

I’d love to get a job there. 

But I think if people actually washed their hands, distanced and wore masks this would have never been an issue. I have traveled for emergency purposes out of state via airplane, I wash my hands I stand more than 6 ft away from people and even at a funeral with family I wore my mask. People get too comfortable around family and take their masks off. My mask is glued to me, I have not contracted COVID at all and have been around 3 people who tested positive, I quarantined and have been tested each time. I live with a high risk person and have done everything I can to keep us protected but I also can’t just sit at home doing nothing, I have to work and provide for my family. If people actually did what they were told to do things would be different.

Sidenote: you’re exaggerating, EVERYTHING isn’t open in SD I live there ;) I literally have picked up my food several times in the past month where dine-in wasn’t an option. Now if you’re talking about PB... yeah those folks over there don’t care and same with Point Loma rich folks on vacation. But the rest of SD is closed.

mbs0hs,gs19cvp,I told my niece about a savings account I made when she was born that is going to pay for her college tuition (or at least most of it),"So I feel I should back up a little bit. I'm not exactly the most sociable person to be around. This stems primarily from my long-time PTSD that I'm still dealing with even after being out of the Marines for so long and also I just don't do great in social settings. I live alone and have had more than my fair share of drug problems after I left the service like a lot of vets. Even my friends that I have that are also veterans have loving families of their own. I was always too afraid that I wouldn't be a good enough dad or would cause some trauma in their lives because of my mental health issues. 

Regarding my niece, I was never really close with her. I would always get her something for her birthday and go to her school performances every year but nothing much beyond that unless absolutely necessary. Again, isolationism was a central part of my character. Sure, I have people that care about me and I care about them, but I again remained distant because I didn't want to trample over their lives with my problems while they have their own. ""My brother's a good man and a great dad, so why should I be that involved in her [my niece's] life?"" is what I thought to myself. Yeah, think about me what you want but that's just how I was. 

So why make a savings for her in the first place then? I honestly don't know. Some small part of me just thought that I should since her parents were going to. And, being a bachelor with no outstanding debts, I could add a little more than her parents could, so I did. Every month I added to it. And I did increase it a bit once I got the higher paying job I do now. 

I asked my brother to get us all together so we could talk about the amount. I went over to their house on Sunday and brought some documents from the bank. She knew I had been saving money for her but obviously no idea as to the amount. So I showed it to her and her face lit up like a Christmas tree. Over $100K, that's how much was there. She immediately reached out hugged me and nearly made me fall out of my chair she was so excited as she thanked me over and over, her parents also had no idea to the amount either. And all I said in response, with a little smile, is ""You're welcome sweetie"". 

I asked if we could talk alone for a little bit and I just told her the basics on how the payment would work and all that. But I also took the moment to apologize for, well, everything. Mostly for not being around more and regretting that I didn't spend more time with her. ""I was just not in a great place for a long time. I didn't want you to have to see me like that. But even when I got better I was afraid of something happening and hurting other people, especially you. Wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did. So I'm sorry"", and she understood, not holding any of it over my head. That was nice. I then told her I love her and kissed her head and she hugged me again. 

I didn't break down or get emotional, but something in me changed after I left and I do feel true happiness for the first time in a long, long time. Maybe I won't ever find love or be happy with another person, I don't know. But as long as my niece is happy, that's fine for now.",You are an amazing person! I'm happy you're happy!,2,0,0

Most of my friends are busy with life like jobs and school and so am I but it just feels like they are always free when I am not. I really only game with like one other friend and lately he kind has been ignoring me to play with his other friends and it most definitely is because I suck at video games but it just sucks when I wanna play and I can't cause I'm always the odd or out. I guess its always kinda been like that, I was never the best at anything so I was always kinda picked last but it sucks when its your friends picking you last as well. I was always fine with playing games by myself but now a days they just dont hit the same. Maybe because of covid but everyday feels the same. The only real joy I get now is playing games with friends and it just feels like they never wanna play. At the same time I do have friends that I could play with but usually they are alwasy busy so I dont bother asking.","Yo, I’ll play with you , ps4 or steam?

jja2v2,gac7fio,"lazy / depressed / sadness ,i don’t know","

I feel like i am too lazy. I want to do my school work. And be good at my job but i seem to fail at everything right now. I can barely respond text messages that ask my concentration , emails. I can’t take myself to pee or brush my teeth, let alone shower. I want to. 
I want to go outside today , go for a walk, but i can’t do all it takes to get there. Getting out of bed, shower etc. 

I hate myself because i feel like i am doing this on purpose. When it doesn’t require my attention, or concentration i am perfectly capable of doing it all. But when it comes to school, and sometimes family and some friends, and all of that it just takes a lot. Sometimes i just leave things that i must do , like renewing my insurance for example, and i know we are in a pandemic but i feel like its a lot. I have good days but i have more bad days.  I used to be a smart kid and used to get things done. Now i have turned into someone so irresponsible. 
I feel like calling my friend, ask them to come over my house and help me get ready so we can take a walk together. I feel like I would have some energy to do that if i see someone else do it with me. But I can’t bother people. I don’t want them to worry but also i just don’t want to have to answer questions and stuff. Plus my room is disorganized right now i don’t want them to see it like that. I am not a dirty and unclean person, when I have good days i clean and organize my room and the house in general but other times I can’t even fold clothes. A friend came over once unannounced and she said hurtful comments about how i should get myself together and organize the place. 
Yesterday was hard. In bed all day, could bare sleep the whole night, i slept at like 7am and woke up 2 hours later. When I don’t sleep a lot ,its the opposite: i don’t sleep at all. Today its almost the same. I feel like I am going to have a bad night as well. I couldn’t breathe at some point yesterday, it was hard. And i felt chest pain. And pain in other parts of my body. I don’t know. 
I just wish this sadness would go away so I can be like others and do my school work, and everything else.","[illness, not weakness ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vYR9JPztdn4&amp;list=PLazcP3-djRZ3_VgA6P42Z0j3dkfyu6WWk&amp;index=1)",0,0,0
ltjq6o,gozioau,Intrusive thoughts won’t stop after my grandpa died,"CW: talk of dead bodies

Hello everyone. My grandpa died of covid and early December. Recently, every few hours my mind tells me “he is decaying in the ground 4 hours away”. I don’t know how to make it stop. This is not my first death and I’ve never had this issue before. This is the first without a viewing and I was able to go to the burial but had to stream the funeral due to covid. Maybe that is part of the reason but I just can’t stop thinking this and I don’t want to anymore. I want to remember him alive and happy not like this. I’ve been to his house and have a few things of his but nothing is helping. I feel like I left him there and I shouldn’t have but obviously I can’t go get him. 

If you have read this far, thank you. I don’t want you thinking of him the same way. He was a dedicated DEA agent who spent his retirement building ramps for the handicapped and riding his motorcycle across country. He donated platelets as often as he could for 40 years up until his death. When he was a rookie officer he stopped a mass shooting. He saved lies. He was a hero.","He's with you in DNA in every cell of your body. What is happening right now, is he is returning the very elements that made his physical form, forged at the beginning of time, back to the earth to become something new. Atoms are eternal. His good life lives on in the legacy of every person's life he touched. Covid had robbed us of the ritual and process of mourning, and we have to find new ways of thinking and managing the loss of our loved ones. It's really hard, I do understand. I lost Dad to Covid in November, and I can see this process being part of my life forever. You've not left him, you've set him free from the confines of the human body.",2,2,0

iisuw1,g3a8nsc,I’m sick of Pro-Life people,"About 6 weeks ago I was raped by someone who I thought was my friend. And now I’ve tested positive for pregnancy, and at first I was going to get an abortion but got in contact with an Infertile friend of mine and asked if she and her husband wanted the child to which they agreed. And even though this fact has been stated several times, I keep getting angry messages of people calling me a murderer for even considering abortion. And they are relentless, and have even gone as far as to create second accounts to contact me after the first one was blocked. Sometimes I wish people would just drop dead...

Edit: This exploded and a lot of people seem to be taking it of context so I feel I should reiterate. I don't hate anyone that's Pro-life, what I hate is when they think abortion should NEVER be allowed and that they will harras people for days, even months on end to change their idea. I personally believe that abortion should only be done if they have explored other options.","Nobody should have the power or authority to force a woman to be pregnant and carry a baby that she doesn't want against her will by threat of punishment!

I get asked on an almost daily basis to help some person essentially drug someone that trusts them so they can get a nut. I’m horrified and every time it happens I sort of shut down because I’m afraid of saying the wrong thing and losing my job. I’ll usually say something like “well our pills can’t be crushed up or dissolved, so I suggest having a conversation with your partner about trying one and allowing them to have informed consent” and they look at me all horrified like “I’m not trying to rape them”.... but they kind of are. Giving someone something to make them horny when they wouldn’t take it if given the choice is such a violation of consent and trust. I would be destroyed if my partner did that to me. How can anyone ever think this is okay?","My ex drugged me one time with a weed brownie (had wax or something in it?) knowing that edibles always made me incredibly sleepy so he could have sex with me.

It's a habit I've had since childhood and getting rid of it like the person suggested is proving to be impossibility. Is this bad? Is this normal? I've never talked to anyone else about this, and the only few people who know do so because they've apparently observed me while I was doing it.","It's more normal than you would think.

Mentally, I'm guessing, it's approximately the same - you'll talk to yourself in order to prepare for a certain situation or to devise a solution that you would have difficulty coming up with if you would only do it in your head. You could summarize this as ""visualization"".

Try not talking to yourself around others - although you might get by with a ""if i do this, then that will happen"" type of convo - and you're dandy fine.

h88o8l,fur359e,I just wish someone would be happy for my fiancé and me for buying our first house.,"My fiancé and I bought our first house this week and both her family and my family are pissed off at us. 

My family think that I bought a money pit because it needs a new roof. However, I’m buying it for $5000 less than appraisal to cover the roof. They are also mad at me because I bought a house 30 minutes from my sister who is pregnant but where she lives is just not what me or my fiancé want to live. The traffic is terrible, it’s nothing but subdivision after subdivision and it’s just not a place we want to live. We picked a small town that we love. Finally they are pissed off that I got a 15 year mortgage even though when I’m ready to sell I’m going to have a larger amount of equity and have paid less interest and I can afford to do it. The mortgage payment is literally $300 less a month than my rent is now. 

Her family are mad at us because they feel like we jumped into this before getting married. We have been together for 6 years and been engaged for 1. We prioritized paying for a house first over paying for a wedding. Mainly because our rent was so high it would be better to decrease our monthly expenses. They are also mad because he wanted me to save up for a 20% down payment. Which to get a 20% down payment I would have to live in the apartment for another 13 months. In that time I would have to pay 17,000 in rent to save $26,000, just so I wouldn’t have to pay a PMI of $29/month. They are also pissed that we didn’t wait for my fiancé to graduate before buying. Which I can kind of see but I already have a down payment saved plus enough to pay for the roof and an emergency fund in case anything happens. And the price of this house is about what we were planning on buying even after she graduated. So why wait?

It just sucks. We have not heard a single positive thing come from them. Nothing like “I’m happy for you but...” This is a huge milestone in our life and no one is happy for us. Everyone is just nit picking about this or that. You can disagree with what we are doing and voice your opinions. But at the end of the day we are adults taking a big life changing step and it deserves to be celebrated.","You're doing a good thing for yourself and everyone hate you for that.

hkaqa3,fwrjrt1,I (F) think I was sexually assaulted by another girl when we were both children,"I was in the 4th grade, I was nine years old and I had a group of friends that were all girls. There was a “friend” who invited me over to her house. Now that I think back, she was not the “friend” I was most close with but I was excited to go to her house anyway. Her mom called my mom and it was decided I was going to ride the bus after school to my “friends” house and then have a play date and then my mom would pick me up at a certain time. Of course I was excited and in the beginning everything was fine. My “friend” took me upstairs to show me her room and began to talk about her believing she was a lesbian. I was shocked and I can’t say I didn’t know what a lesbian was, but I was innocent. I didn’t know what sex was. She began to go on about how she had a crush on me and I was again shocked but didn’t really get the scope of that. She began to explain some and then asked me if I was a lesbian. I told her I didn’t know. She proceded to force me to do sexual acts with her and claimed that if I didn’t do what she wanted she would tell her mom and my mom that I had hit her and bullied her. I was young and naive and had no backbone whatsoever. I was a teachers pet and I absolutely hated getting in trouble. I didn’t know what to do. When she asked me to do it again, I said no and told her I didn’t care if she told her mom I hit her (in my mind maybe I could go home). She didn’t and for the rest of the night I was stuck at that house. I had to eat dinner next to her, watch a movie with her and her family and the whole time I was trying not to cry. 

When my mom came to pick me up I was so relieved. When we got in the car I immediately started crying but I was so disgusted and embarrassed and so I lied and told her that my “friend” had only forced me to kiss her. When we got home my mom asked if she should call my “friend’s” mom and I said no. She then proceeded to lowkey joke about the situation and find it funny and that absolutely broke me. But I didn’t hold a grudge because she didn’t know the true story. 

For the next couple of years I had to go to school with this girl, sit next to this girl in Spanish class, have her weirdly try to talk to me in the bathroom and say hi. I HATED her and I HATE her now. Seeing pictures of her (which is inevitable in a small town where everyone is Facebook friends) makes me sick to my stomach. But nobody knew the real story and I just brushed it off. I told myself it was just her being curious, that it wasn’t my fault (which it wasn’t) but I still had so much pain about it. It still never crossed my mind that what she had done was sexual assault because we were both kids. But it still felt so evil and like she had invited me over just for that purpose and to manipulate me just to use me for her own personal gain. We were both nine years old, we were children but I still felt violated in so many ways.                    

When I was in middle school I tearfully wrote a letter to my sister explaining what had actually happened and she told me she had a feeling that this had happened and she looked so sad for me. I think she knew I was torn up about it. When I was in high school, I finally began to think about the reality of what actually happened. Why I always felt the need to have an escape plan if I were to go to someone’s house, have a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation. Again, it felt like I had been violated and assaulted but it was a female child. Was that even possible? I googled it and it says it is but I still feel like if I come out and tell people my story that it will be invalidated. This has caused so many problems in my life and I’m just now ready to come to terms with it.","I’m so, so sorry you had to go through that. What happened to you is assault and both of you being girls doesn’t invalidate that. I hope you find the strength to tell others your story, but even if you don’t that’s ok too.

fwyex4,fmr8r68,I was just given the opportunity to break up with my relatively long standing girlfriend but I didn’t.,"My girlfriend loves me, loves me to death I would say. She’s the type of person who couldn’t live without their significant other. 

I on the other hand could live without talking to my S/O all day.

She is also very emotional as where I have trouble keeping up with her.
We’ve been together for about 2 and a half years now, which to me is a relatively long time since this is my first real relationship.
But we fight about the smallest (to me) things all the time. For instance, she made a piece of artwork. It was beautiful, amazing but maybe something that was too intricate for its purpose. Everyone said it was amazing she was able to make it but had some constructive criticism about it. She couldn’t take it, called me saying she’s horrible at everything and everyone hates her creation. I try to be considerate and say that it is beautiful but she needs to listen and learn how to take suggestions and starts crying. Starts saying that I don’t love her because I don’t care that she is crying. But she does this every time. Every time I don’t support her side she always cries and acts up. I try to not just support her side but try to take the stance that in my mind is the most reasonable. I lose my shit because I’m tired of this shit happening again yaddayadda.

I also have a story about her parents as well but its a long one, I’ll spare you the details. Basically her parents are super religious and said no dating before marriage, told me to break up with her and we have been in “hiding” for 2 years.

However we just got off a call after our fight and we talked about everything. How she thinks that I put a lot of effort into the relationship even though I’m busy. How she can be unreasonable sometimes. How she believes if we stay together, in the long run she will be fine but is concerned for my patience and mental health. I legitimately think about how my life could be so much easier not being in a relationship. So much of my time would be freed up. I could make choices without taking to account my S/O. I would be a free man to do what I wish. 

But the repercussions would be severe. I couldn’t do it. I don’t want heartbreak. And I chose to keep the relationship together as I cried in front of the camera. I cried because I knew how much more of these fights I would have to go through. I cried because I didn’t know if I loved her anymore. I don’t feel anything when I’m with her. I don’t know why I made that decision.

Maybe it was because I didn’t want to deal with my friends asking about her. Or maybe I was optimistic in thinking everything would be ok if I just stuck to it. I don’t know. I hope I made the right choice.

My ex-girlfriend and I (19f) broke up 3 weeks ago. It's harsh to say, but since our relationship wasn't good at all in the end, I don't really miss her personally. I just miss having someone. Because of lockdown, she was the only person I could see. Now that we broke up, I don't have anyone else to see. 

I graduated high school without being able to say goodbye to my classmates and started uni without being able to really meet new people. This makes everything so hard. 

I've made friends at uni, but since I only see them once a week for a short amount of time, the friendships aren't that deep. I don't really know them that well. I once asked them to hang out, but with COVID-19 we can only do things outdoors. The day we were planning to do something it started raining. After that they asked only once to do something and again the weather was just too awful. I don't dare to ask again, I don't want to be pushy. 

In the meantime, I'm losing friends from high school. Two of my best friends from high school started excluding me in my senior year and have stopped talking to me. All conversations I have with old classmates are just kind small talks. My best friend from high school never starts a conversation or asks to hang out. When I propose to do something, she does make time and we have a lot of fun. It's just that she never takes initiative and it makes me insecure. 

I really am that friend that randomly asks you how you're doing. I also really want to put effort into relationships and friendships. I wish someone would take the time to do the same thing for me.

g4c7kg,fnwn2x6,[Long] Not sure what to do anymore,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

M[35], single

I kind of got to a point I don't know what to do with my life as I don't see any purpose of it anymore...

I work in international IT company, have good salary, but hate my job so much. It is very boring, I don't have feeling I am making any difference and just have to pretend I actually do something because in reality I have maybe 1-2hr of work daily. The rest I have to pretend to do something. 

I have functional depression. I am dead inside, no interests, no real hobbies, not interested in relationships.. but have to pretend to be normal person every day.

I had relationships before, always lasted only few months because I lose interest. The same with hobbies... and jobs.. and everything else. There are things I like. For example cooking. I like that and I think I am good at it. But I just don't have strength to do it. I would just order delivery or buy frozen shit because it takes fast to prepare compared to normal cooking. I hate it. 

My days are the same. Wake up, go to work, go home, shop, eat, sit behind computer/read book/go to gym/sleep. Repeat. Weekend the same except the job part. Usually stay at home behind computer.

I ""used"" to be smart. I was good in school. I know I can be good at tasks. But I don't have strength. People think I am lazy. I don't want to discuss with them my mental problems. I get low performance reviews in jobs and have to listen to people saying they expect more. I just can't force myself to be better. I have no motivation to improve. I have no motivation to do anything for myself. I don't educate myself anymore.. 

I like to be alone, but not lonely. I recently had discussion with my manager because he had feeling I am not team player as I don't socialise with colleagues and don't participate in team events. I am trying. But in general I don't care. Nothing personal, they are nice people, I just don't care, I am not interested. But I told my manager I will try to improve this. 

I met a girl recently. We talked, we flirted, we went out, all was good, I lost interest. She didn't do anything wrong. She is pretty, nice, successful I just don't have energy to deal with relationships. I kind of ghosted her and feel like shit about it. Poor girl. But then again I don't want to explain her how fucked up I am.

I starting to have panic attacks. It is getting more and more frequent. They are light but it is not good. I often feel like crying, feel helpless..

I never been to psychiatrist and decided to go. But thanks to Corona all psychiatrists work only online and I kind of don't feel comfortable doing it this way. 

I need medication for my problems, but on the other hand I don't expect any miracles. I am worried it will not help. 

I want to change job but now is not good time, I was thinking to ask inside company for something I would prefer but I am worried it will get to my manager and will have consequences. I can not lose job. I don't have any savings left. 

I have moved to new city at beginning of year I don't know anyone here. But I was loner also in previous city and I was kind of ok with that. I don't have any attachments build. I am even not really in contact with my family.

I am just fucked. And really don't know what to do anymore. Nothing makes me happy and if, then only for short time. I am thinking often about ending it, but won't do it. Still feel some kind of responsibility and I am worried that it will hurt or that I will mess up and it will end badly. 

I don't even expect anything from this post. I maybe just wanted to get out what bothers me as I don't have anyone irl to talk to about this","I read the whole thing and buddy, I haven't been through what you have gone through and I have a lot less life experience. But I just want to say that I hope things better and I think you have a right to feel like that because depression is fucking rough. I hope things get better.",1,2,0

gey7c7,fpu6mwe,I wasn't ready for university,"For context, I don't live in the US. I don't have to pay for college, only for apartment, food, etc.

I started college this year in January and moved out of my home to do that. My gf from 4 years was there also but broke up with me about two weeks in. I started to notice things were not right before and couldn’t focus on school but was still good. After we actually broke up I started to feel better so I wasn’t stressed about it happening anymore.

I thought I was doing good about it but felt all alone because I didn’t have anyone else and couldnt take it out of my chest. So even if I got over it fairly quick, I still had all those feelings bottled inside.

I've always had self esteem issues. Couldn't make new friends so was still alone. I'm not good at it, I'm friendly and I think people like me, but not enough to want me around often so I try to keep my distance. I thought it was just a matter of time but after some months started to realize almost everybody had friends except me. Luckily, there was this girl that had a crush on me and we eventually became friends. I am really happy to have her in my life now but I still felt the same because I couldn't make new relationships by myself.

I can't explain why exactly, but all that time I could not move.  Was not hungry anymore, couldn't stand eating anything, couldn't get out of bed for anything.

Eventually, quarantine started and it destroyed me even more. I came back home, but the last bit of motivation still inside me disappeared. Barely moved for a month until I realized what I was doing. Eventually started to  become insane, thinking about how I wanted to go back for not taking advantage of the opportunities (personal, social and academic) I got there. But still managed to fuck up more and do nothing about it, maybe the pressure of actually going to classes helped a little.

This could not have been in a worst moment. My mom has been unemployed for a couple of months and is about to move to another town so she can work and we stay here at home. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail at most 3 out of 5 classes.

I am pretty sure something serious is happening to me, I've never been diagnosed so I don't like saying this, but I've felt pretty bad for some years so I think I truly am depressed.

For weeks I've been  feeling like I'm going insane with this guilt. For months I didn't say anything because didn't wanted to worry my family or friends here and hoped things would get better, now it's too late. My mom doesn't have the money, so I don't feel like telling her I need therapy (although I've been looking on the internet if there's something free or affordable I can get). I feel so bad because I do know there's something wrong with me because it is not the first time, it even is the worst I've been. If I fail a class, I need to pay for vacation school so I can get  to next semester, it isn't that expensive depending on how many people take it, but I ain't failing just one.

I always wasted my time, not having fun, not doing something I like; just being scared of people and doing things. I totally regret it so I thought I needed to leave so I could overcome it by myself but got really worse. At first thought about dropping chemistry this semester so I could take it later after getting used to that life but thought it would be mediocre from my part.

If I don't pass this semesters' classes, I have to repeat next year. Of course I am willing to do anything I have to, if she wants me to work, repeat, whatever. I can handle the punishment but not the shame and guilt of dissapointing my family so bad. I am avoiding talking to others because I don't feel worthy of them. I was a pretty good student on high school and college classes weren't even that difficult, I just felt and still feel so lost. They all believe I'm doing good with it. I can accept my mistakes but I never stop punishing myself over them, specially if it involves people I love.

Don't know what to do. If I tell her now, I fear she will not go to her work and she needs it. If I tell her letar, I don't know how will it affect her living alone in other place. I feel like I really need therapy, but I feel like it is a stupid reason to do what I did ~~or didn't do.~~ I don't want to use it as an excuse. So I don't know how to approach the topic without looking like I'm playing the victim.

I feel like a total stupid, I'm not affraid of my  personal consecuences but I am of how my family will feel. I've had nightmares almost every night now, avoid talking to friends by text and enjoyinng things because I feel the need to punish myself; avoid texting or reading class groups becuase of shame and avoid my family because I now I will let them down soon and can't stand pretending I'm okay and there's nothing wrong.

TL; DR: I have been severely unmotivated and depressed since January, wasn't ready for college, completely failed the semester and am affraid of how my family will feel.

Maybe wil add some things later if I forgot anything or think something isn't well explained.","Okay, I’m sorry you are going through some rough times.

hks0hq,fwy3aik,My dad's going to be taken off life support tomorrow,"My dad was the man I looked up to the most in my life. He was so sociable, friendly, caring, hard working and funny. Out of nowhere on June 27th he passed out several times and was taken to the hospital by my mom and brother. He had been feeling a little sick before that but not really sick until that day. I was at my apartment and after my brother called and told me, my boyfriend drove me to the emergency room where he was. I kept talking about how he wasn't going to die and he was going to be okay, he was just sick and exhausted from working at his job too much. The doctors thought he had a heart attack so they check out his arteries and told us they looked very healthy. I kept thinking there was no way he was going to die. I remember going home that night and we laughed at how when my mom was going to take him to the hospital he was crab walking to the car. We laughed because we never thought he would actually die. 

He kept getting worse, the doctors diagnosed him with myocarditis. They figured it stemmed from some sort of infection he was fighting, but he was healthy before. A couple of weeks ago he had been feeling bad. He got a covid test and it was negative, but he tested positive for the covid antibodies. He just figured it was a sinus infection, which my family gets a lot. In the hospital he tested negative for covid twice. This whole time we've remained hopeful as the doctors said he could still fully recover, even though he was very sick. Even when I found out after he was careflighted to a different hospital his heart stopped for 5 minutes and they revived him with cpr, I thought the worst was over and he would recover. This morning, my mom went to see him and I called her at noon. He had been stable since Tuesday night, but he had now gotten worse. My mom told me as soon as she saw him today, she knew he was mentally gone. 

I have obviously felt bad and sympathetic whenever I would hear a family member of someone had died, but I never would have expected it to feel like this. I know my family will get through this, but I don't know how we are going to be the same without him. He was a light in my life and thinking about how I will never see him walking around, talking and laughing again hurts me to my core. I've had people tell me I am like him personality wise. I just don't want to forget him or lose that part of myself. It hurts so much knowing he won't see me graduate college, be married, have a career and family. The thoughts that bring me peace are knowing he will never have to work another day and he will no longer be in pain. 

Rest easy dad, I am so proud to be your daughter.","My heart just breaks for you and your family. I lost my husband, my children lost their dad, much the same way a year ago. He was fine, working, feeling puny but nothing crazy, and was diagnosed with pneumonia. OK, antibiotics and steroids and he'll be right as rain. Except he wasn't. On his second night in hospital he suffered a brain bleed and when the neuro surgeon went in to get the clot out it just shattered into a million pieces. He was immediately left blind, paralyzed, and so on. Seeing him on life support 24 hours after I'd brought him a burger and a chocolate shake--nothing in life prepares us for that. 

You know your dad, and whether he would ever tolerate being unable to perform all the tasks he's managed for his entire life. We knew ours would never have the patience or the humility to be a lifelong ""patient."" In that respect, it was best he went. We would never want anyone we love so much to suffer, to be sick for a long time, to feel too bad to do what they like to do. He's being spared that. I believe in time you can balance all the aspects of it out and find peace in knowing your dad was spared a drawn-out period of being bedridden, feeling so weak and unwell, unable to do what he enjoys. For now, though, how do we get from day to day, from hour to hour? We just do, sweetie. We just breathe and we keep breathing.

I've spent today trying to clean out my husband's office. I have to take it in small little bites bc I start crying. There is no schedule for grieving loss. No timetable that by Day 47 you should have accomplished A. Nah. You just move on and it goes like it goes. Dad knows you love him, appreciate him, honor him. You always will. He knows that. So be grateful he didn't have to suffer, celebrate your love for him, and know that friends and family are lifting you up. Let them. Don't turn them away.  However you deal with losing Dad is permissible, as long as you don't hurt yourself or get locked up. Remember, breathe. And keep breathing. Safe-distancing hugs to you xxoo",2,2,0

We kept at it for a long time and I made some advances. Some went well. Some went shit.

She got pissed at me. Tried just leaving my sexual shit alone and acted minimally and she hated it. She banned porn. Everything. No release. 

I just kept going and going. And this morning she broke up. Citing the sexual shit as a reason. I was shattered. I told her that it was for the best. Better for her.

I dunno either way though. There are ideas about backwards time travel and grandfather paradoxes etc that potentially could explain why things like this happen. The whole “you’re here for a reason” might turn out to be true. It feels like the reason is nothing good though, I know that.

Since the lockdown began, I have been having episodes of feeling depressed and hopeless. During those episodes, either I get visibly upset, I shut down completely, or sometimes both. It has gotten to the point where I will never go out for any reason; if going out requires me to wear a mask, socila distance and/or practice other measures, I'd rather not go out at all. It would be to depressing to see these measures being practiced and I am not the adaptive type.

I'm in therapy. I've dealt with ptsd due to childhood trauma all my life. But this is different. This is fresh and raw and it plays like a movie in my head. It hurts and I know I will get through it but I hate so much that this happened to her. She was only 52 and she is just gone. For the last two weeks of her life she was just trapped in her body and had no control and I know she would have hated that. 

This is really just a mind dump because I don't know anyone that could understand. I have two siblings but we are not currently speaking to each other. It's a very complicated and difficult situation. 

Thank you for listening.","I lost my mom in March, similar but different circumstances and the sibling situation has been the hottest of hot messes. I see you.

I have had moments of clarity where I know that my mom is so so happy where she is now. So much happier than when I last saw her.

I have had moments of deep sadness, too, obviously. And today when I was in a strong, unexpected funk, crying in a store (or several different stores admittedly) I had a lightbulb moment when I heard a little voice say “it’s okay to be sad you know. It actually makes sense to be sad right now.” I have no idea where the voice came from (maybe a tiny man in the supermarket next to me but probably just somewhere deep in my conscious) but it broke my thought cycle and it really helped. I was sad, because this IS sad. A weight lifted off me in that moment - everything’s kind of on track even though it’s not the track I’d have picked (but no one gets to live forever anyway so it was always going to be too soon even if it could have been less painful for her) 

I suppose what I’m trying to say in a cheaper way than your therapist is all your feelings are valid. Try to feel them and know that they are all ok, even the awful ones. Show up for yourself like you showed up for your mum in the end; even when it’s painful and plain awful.

kzdg1p,gjnxt1z,Nursing is not an honorable profession,"
It’s not. Nurses are honorable humans. Nursing is not an honorable profession. I’ve been a nurse since I was 18 (dual enrolled in college while still in high school). I have pictures of me dressed as a nurse for career day in elementary school. You see them when you go to the doctor. You see them when you’re visiting family in the hospital. They’re superheroes. Of the most honorable of professions. Except they’re not. 

We are superheroes, that much is true. But working in health care for 8 years has taught me that the profession is not honorable. If anything, it’s the exact opposite. It’s disgusting. 
We cannot be the people we want to be. We can’t treat people how we want to treat them. We can’t provide the care we want to provide. We want to give people what they deserve, and we can’t. And there’s nothing we can do about it. 

The people who employ us do not care about us, or the patients we care for. They care about the amount of money they profit from running a business as corrupt as the drug trade. I’ve seen it all. The more I see, the more I despise my profession and the healthcare industry that I work for and have spent years devoting myself to. I’m in school now working toward becoming a nurse practitioner. And I’m failing. Because my heart isn’t in it. Because I know that I can’t provide the care people deserve. 

I’ve worked in long term care and have seen people come in for alcoholism or just because they need a place to live. And their insurance has paid for them to stay there for years although we do nothing for them but provide a bed. I’ve seen people come in with 3rd degree burns or wounds so extensive there’s no way they can go home and not suffer life threatening consequences, but their insurance kicks them out anyway because they’ve met their therapy potential. They can walk. So they have to go home. Likely to die. With wounds or illnesses that require hospital grade treatment and round the clock care. 

I’ve worked in the hospital and have seen people be discharged way before they should’ve been so we can empty a bed for a new admit. 

I’ve worked in home health and have seen people discharged who need the services. Not having nursing visits would be absolutely detrimental to their wellbeing. But an insurance issue arises and they’re cut loose with maybe a 24-48 hour notice that they’re going to have to figure something else out. 

I’ve worked long hours with no staff. Knowing that my patients aren’t being cared for like they should be but also knowing there’s only so much you can do when you don’t have any bodies to help. 

I’ve watched administrators and DONs pull the dirtiest shit I’ve ever seen to cover their own ass. And the ass of the facility. But if you speak up, you’re fired and they still win. Because they’ve already covered all their tracks. 
I’ve seen people not receive life saving operations they need because of insurance. I’ve seen people die when they shouldn’t have. They absolutely shouldn’t have. I’ve pieced together things to provide the care needed because we don’t have the supplies our patients need. 

I’ve worked in a covid war zone. Sick people everywhere. While sick with covid myself. Starting 20 ivs a shift when I needed ivs myself. Running out of oxygen concentrators. Knowing they’re all sick and need care but there’s no staff so prioritizing the sickest first. Just trying to prevent as many deaths as I can. Crying when they do die because I know there was more that could’ve been done but beyond my capacity. Running out of IV kits and just looking for anything and everything that could work. Running out of medications. Reusing the same PPE for weeks. Not having time to spend with patients because we have 1000 pages of paperwork to do. Without paperwork there’s nothing to send to insurance companies. No profit for the company. 

I’ve cried to administrators and Directors. I’ve even cried at the state level. And have been dismissed with all but my dignity. 

Nurses are superheroes. Nurses are honorable. Nursing is not an honorable profession. The healthcare industry is so corrupted. Nurses are treated like shit. We’re loved when we can pull overtime. We’re treated like garbage-Absolute garbage-When we’re sick or something prevents us from raking in profit for the day. 

The health care industry does not care about the health of its employees or patients. It does not care about morals. It does not care about treating humans with the respect and decency they deserve. It cares about profit. And there’s nothing -nothing- we can do about it, but continue to fight in a war for a team we know does not have the best intentions at heart. Which kills our souls a little more each time we punch the time clock. 

I’m in school to become a nurse practitioner. And in every scholarship letter, I write that our health care system is severely flawed, and I hope to eventually one day make a difference, If even a tiny one. And I haven’t given up on that hope yet.",I think I’d make a correction. Nursing IS an honorable profession but not an honored one.,0,0,0
j86j81,g892hg7,My future will be bad so I can't stop thinking about suicide,"22F here.

I know it sounds a bit stupid because nothing really bad is happening to me yet, but at the same time...I feel like I was doomed to have a shitty life from the start. Basically, I live in a country where the unemployment rate is very high, especially among youths. Because of COVID, our economy went from bad to worse. In my country, the only degrees that will probably get you a job are most engineering degrees or healthcare degrees such as medicine and nursing. I know that in no country does a degree guarantee you a job, but here you're much more likely to end up unemployed even with these difficult degrees, let alone Social Science degrees like Marketing or Business, or Humanity degrees. I chose an English degree because it's the only thing I think I'm good at (though I'm forgetting my English lately). My plan was to become a teacher because it's the only real job you can get out of a Humanities degree here. I don't think I like teaching though.

All this has made me think that there's no point of me being alive because no matter what career path I choose, I will end up miserable either way. If I become teacher, I will probably dislike it. Public school teachers here can't get fired, get a decent pay and get a good work schedule, but you have to go through very rigorous exams where you compete with other aspiring teachers. People can spend a decade or more studying and retaking this exam every two years to get this job stability. Plus, such hard work for a job that I don't like seems pointless, even with these benefits. In my country they rarely hire you for something that is unrelated to your degree unless you studied Maths or something, so I can't just ""not go into teaching"". It doesn't work that way. And even if I did try to study another degree, do a programming bootcamp, etc. what's the point? I'm not good at the subjects I need to study in those degrees, nor do the jobs interest me. I'm not smart enough either. Heck, I'm not a smart person in general. and even if I were, I could still end up unemployed, or fired and never find another job after that (which happens here). I might just end up unemployed and homeless anyway because the exams to be a teacher are too hard and require too much motivation.

I'm just constantly miserable, thinking of killing myself once I finish my degree, or when I'm 25, or when I'm 30 if I'm still around. I feel so trapped in my own decisions and circumstances. I just can't find the joy in things like I used to. I loved my degree, but now I'm in my final year and I'm starting to get tired of the classes. What's the point of them if they won't get me anywhere? I guess I don't really want to die, I just wish I had the certainty that life was worth living. That I won't end up bitter and sad, sacrificing my 20s to study day in and day out for job that I won't even like. Or studying a different degree for the sake of a ""guaranteed"" job only to not be able to finish my degree or not get employed. Or working day and night at a minimum wage job barely getting by, or not having a job at all, which seems very likely. I know there's not much anyone can say to make my situation any better, I just wanted to let this all out. Sorry for the long text if you've gotten this far.","Let's look at things here... First of all, you say you're not smart, but you're smart enough to figure out what's going on in your head. You're even smart enough to guess the future... The only issue with that, you can never be 100% sure. So, realistically, you can do what I did. Give up, never finish your degree and be 100% sure you'll never really amount to much... Or, you can give it your best shot, where you might or might not get a decent job. A job you might or might not enjoy. After all, education is an investment into your future. Unfortunately, if you know anything about business, you will realise some investments don't pay off.

So risk it for the biscuit, or give up and plan your failure. The choice is yours.

I know, these things are probably not what you wanna hear, and I know it gets fucking rough. I've posted on SW myself before. Not even sure if it helped. All I know is... You miss 100% of the shots you don't take... So give it your best fucking shot.

fr3jnu,fltt4kw,Anyone else feel like life is passing them by?,"This isn't just a quarantine post, but the quarantine stuff feels like it's bringing this stuff to the forefront. This is mostly just a rant.

I'm 22 years old and I'm essentially in my sophomore year of college after swapping majors twice (long story) and it feels like I'm missing a lot in life right now. All my friends from high school are graduating (well, just finishing their undergrad degrees considering that everywhere is canceling their graduations what with the COVID-19 stuff) and here I am just spinning my wheels. I had to drop one of my classes this semester because I have enough trouble focusing on in-person classes, and online classes make that a thousand times worse, and it's just making me feel like I've fallen even farther behind my peers.

I haven't dated anyone in over a year, and I recently found out that my last boyfriend just got engaged. Like, yeah, I'm happy for him and everything, but also he's moving on and I'm just not. Like I don't dwell on our relationship, but again I haven't really dated anyone since then. That's one of the drawbacks of staying with your parents, I guess. Is the money I'm saving worth it? Totally, but it still feels bad to not be able to really date anyone while living here. Also the whole pandemic thing puts a damper on that too. Can't forget about that.

n9qo1t,gxq1s4q,I was abused by an ENTIRE school,"Tw\ Abuse, Sexual Harrasment, Trauma






First of all I want to start this story off by saying this is all true, and if this blows up I'll give out the name of the school.

I started out at this school in elementary, I had no friends and was already being bullied a couple of days in. I was closeted (gay) and I was bullied heavily by many students and teachers. Soon after they started hitting and pushing me, then they would throw cheese on me and call me a rat and make fun of my front two teeth ( which look normal looking back) I kept telling the principal but he would just get one of the main bullies in the office and force ME to confront him, but I was having panic attacks everytime I was near him, along with this I would have a severe panic attack every day because at this school if you don't do homework you get called into the office for swats(spankings with a big paddle) but things only get worse from here.

Middle school is where things go from children bullying and teachers just being rude to full on abuse and law breaking.

I was extremely depressed by 6th grade and later was starting to be forced into sports( the school makes you do band or sports or both) and I chose to be a water  boy instead of a football player. 
I had to do laundry and practice with them etc

But one day in the boys changing room the main bully (well call him Alex) got mad at me for changing in the corner (I was insecure about my body)

Alex: *pulls me out of the corner* why are you hiding from me? Why don't you wanna change in front of me?

Me: I just don't want anyone looking at me, it's not about you. Please give me my clothes back.

I was so ashamed and embarrassed, but it got worse from here, Alex would grope me when I would pass him in the hall way or classroom and would endlessly harrass me. I finally decided to tell the coaches and this is what happened.

Me: Coach @&amp;# Alex is doing really creepy things to me and forcing me to change in front of him

Coach: YOU'RE LYING!! YOU JUST WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO YOU FAGGOT!!

Then he proceeded to give me swats and yell at me, my (abusive) friend was there with me for ""moral"" support and never stood up for me ever.

Meanwhile everyday I was being abused by the 2 completely different principals in the midde-highschool, the elementary principal was actually really cool but he had to follow stupid and abusive rules. But we'll call the Principal who was also a Coach Manny and we'll call the Overall (main) Principal Egghead (because he's mean )

Egghead would give me increasing numbers of swats everyday for not doing a homework assignment but I was so horribly depressed I couldn't muster the energy to do anything.

And he would insult me every time he saw me, if he didn't feel like swatting me he would make Manny, Manny had less of a problem with me but he didn't like me either, he thought I was a delinquent even though I had all A's and B's from test grades (we took alot so hw didn't matter) and I never acted up.

I went to Egghead about the bullying problem and he said ""maybe that's what you need to grow up""

I had to leave and I cried in the bathroom for half an hour and Alex somehow found me in there and pushed me against the wall and called me a faggot.

This pushed me over the edge and I attempted suicide later that day, however as I was only around 11 I didn't know that Benedryl wasnt lethal if you took a whole bottle and I ended up having a panic attack and told my mom, we went to the er and they told her I was fine.

Soon after my mother went up to the school (she didn't mention the suicide attempt)and Egghead assured her ""no students would bully me""

And magically for about 2 weeks I was safe.

But soon after Alex and a couple of his friends stole all of my clothes and pushed me (naked) into a stall. Alex was looking me up and down then started making fun of me and held the door closed while his other friend grabbed a shower head and they doused me with freezing cold water and then boiling hot and then cold.

After that I was just so broken, I couldn't do it anymore, I was so depressed I didn't feel anything anymore, I was empty, looking back I don't even consider myself as alive at the time.

A couple of years while this was all still happening to me a lose it.

I get called to the office for my daily swats and Egghead decides to make me wait and extra 20 minutes and the bell rings so I assume he forgot about me and tried to go to class. Of course the second I get to class, Egghead, Manny,and 1 other storm into the classroom and yell at me in front of everyone, humiliating me in front of one of the few kind teachers and my only real friend. I was pissed.

We go to the office, I had an epiphany.......I have free will, I'm allowed to say no, I don't have to put up with it anymore.

I started crying and I said ""I'm not going in there""(his office )

Egghead gets instantly pissed ""Well look who thinks he's in charge"" as he laughs at me with the secretary (who he slept with often at school)
He calls me a ""faggot""

I'm enraged

I tell him ""I'm done with you, I'm not doing this anymore, I can't"" 

He calls my mom and tries to lie to her to make me look evil, my mom comes up to the school and I stood up for myself and immediately ran into her van crying and telling her I'm not going back. She tries to convince me to but I told her I've been begging to leave for nearly a decade and I just can't put up with it for her anymore (I haven't told her everything that happened to me, just that I was bullied) and she marches inside and I'm crying harder than I ever have, I was hysterical. My class was heading to an outdoor center and they all saw me and we're giggling as they passed and it made me so embarrassed.

Soon my mom comes outside and tells me she took all of us out of the school and that were going home.


When I get home, I have a message it was from one of Alex's friends saying
 
""I'm so sorry, I heard about everything.
We treated you like shit and I did too, I'm so sorry,                I literally can't stop thinking about how fucked up it is,we were all uncomfortable with the creepy sexual stuff he would do to you we just didn't know what to do or say, if there's anything I can do let me know.""

First of all he want even that bad the only thing he really did was mild name calling and he stole my clothes a couple times, but it meant alot because it validated the way I felt. His father was also the only kind coach other than one other (Im only talking about the male coaches)

They have cameras in the school but idk if they work and I'm worried about sharing my story because they might try to sue or something and they own the cameras and footage.

Also alot of it happened in the locker rooms where there are no cameras so it might be a bad idea to give out the name of the school but I'm so tired of hiding what happened to me because of fear and I'm scared that it may still be happening even though they have a new principal.

What should I do? Also please give me advice because I have so much trauma from this entire experience, the rest of my life was also traumatic and this just sprinkled a little more on.

I'm gonna post this in other Reddit threads to get my story outvjust so you know.

Thank you for reading all of this, I really mean it from the bottom of my heart.ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ","There’s a lot in this story that doesn’t connect. Enough that I’m going to say this is a complete fabrication, and is riddled with inconsistencies.

n442ie,gwtuv6l,I missed out on teenage romance,"I(23M) was always fascinated watching my friends/peers having a relationship and being in love. The blissful start,the shaky moments and pain, the falling off, everything truly made me want it. The feeling of someone loving me. At first I used to yearn for it, striking up conversations with mutuals and even asked my crushes out without any prior conversation(dumb, ik). 
But now I've totally given up since whatever I do I won't feel the same about it again. I want to feel loved. I've wanted it as long as I remember.","I was, and to some extent still am, dealing with that, too. All throughout my high school career, I always daydreamed about finding some sort of love to enjoy during and after school. I'm eighteen now, turning nineteen in a few months, and I graduated high school last year. Any chance of obtaining youthful love in my lifetime is mostly gone. So, I understand how you feel. It's very debilitating and upsetting.",0,2,0
gytnlq,ftcsgen,"It's Angry Hours ™ , boys","This is rambly and near incoherent but read on if you want.

In the past year and a half or so, I've found myself having some rather interesting intrusive (ish? If I wanted to, I could shake them off, but I've found a sort of fascination with them) thoughts. They're violent, weird, and a little fucked up. Look, feel free to go ahead and say, ""Ah, another teen filled with angst and hormones. You'll get over it, calm down edgelord."" But they don't *really* bother me. I've come close to acting on them, and only stopping myself because I didn't want to deal with the consequences and further finding myself somewhat alienated. Not that it matters now, obviously, since 1) it's summer break and 2) there's that virus that hinders social interaction.

What my point here is, I'm always angry with other people. I always find myself annoyed with how they talk, how they act, their general existence. But I'm an extrovert; that is, I somehow also *gain* energy by being around people. In general, I'm a very contradictory person by nature. Why that is, I don't know. It's starting to bother me more, now that I've had a taste of self-isolation (ignoring the fact that I live with immediate family). To be honest, I don't really want to do anything about it. Yeah, I'm in counselling, but I have one more session left, and I don't think that I should bring it up because I don't really want to change anyway. It's probably ""unhealthy"", but I want to let this fester. I want to wait until I get so manic and feel so much and finally just *do* something, or until I feel absolutely nothing at all except this pure, raw anger and frustration. I look forward to that. I'll finally have control, ""free will"", whatever that may mean. Hell, I don't even know what it means. But I know what it's not, and it's not any sort of murder spree, serial killing rampage. That sounds like sarcasm. Fuck. Just take my word for it, however much value that has for you.

Anyway this is getting bigger than I initially had in mind, so I'll just awkwardly end it. If you somehow read it, understood it, and have questions/feedback let me know.

gmv6o7,fr67a7x,I think I’m falling into another depression,"   Hey I’m 18F. If you have seen my past post you (if not that’s ok) would notice I have lived a rough life. I grew up in a very toxic family dynamic. When I was 12 was when I feel into my first depression. It felt worst than what I am feeling now to the point where I contemplated suicide at one point. This was triggered by me witnessing my dad domestically abuse my mom by beating her with a tv remote. Also, by the relentless bullying I got from school. I had no friends and no family that was close by. Lucky I pulled myself out of that depression through learning what my feeling meant and how to take care of myself emotionally by distancing myself from my parents. 
  Now the feelings are coming back because due to college closing I had to move back to my parents place and it’s just as toxic. They are divorcing and it’s an ugly one. My mom uses me as an emotional crux while my dad is trying to gaslight me to forget about what he did to my mom, me, and brother (abuse). It doesn’t help that I’m isolated from my friends and other family members because of COVID-19. Can anyone give me some advice or just be a friend.","Hi, I want to be your friend.

nybtbo,h1kjv0m,My husband was committed yesterday.,"I (33M) have been with my husband (39M) since 2012. We've been married three years. We both see therapists for depression and anxiety. He's admitted to me that he's not always truthful with his therapist. 

Yesterday I was at work whenever I got a call from him. He knows I can get in trouble if I'm on my phone and to only call in emergencies.  I pick up and he tells me that he needs me to come pick him up. I can't get off work for an hour but I tell him I'd try to leave early.

I text him a few minutes later and ask him what's happened. He texts me back and reveals that he's had a bad outburst at work and been taken into the head managers office. His bosses are actually really caring and managed to get him to open up to them. He tells them that he's in pain (he was recently diagnosed with lupus) and he feels like his life is over. He tells them that he's planning on going home and killing himself. They tell him they can't let him leave by himself, thus he calls me. He tells me that he's only upset that he had the outburst because otherwise he could have went home and ""finally succeeded"".

I get to his job to pick him up and his boss pulls me to the side, tells me about the suicidal threat, and says that hes contacted police for a wellness check. I tell his boss that I'm taking him straight to the local crisis clinic. We leave, and my husband convinces me to let him go home and take a quick shower. I keep an eye on him and he gets dressed and we go to leave our house.

At the end of the driveway we see a cop. He comes up to us and I tell him that I'm taking him to the crisis center. 

We arrive and my husband tells the staff that he was planning on od'ing on his medication that night. They take him inside and I have to sit outside due to covid concerns. Three hours pass by and the doctor comes out to tell me that he'll be transported to a local psychiatric hospital.  They advise me to get him some clothing from home and his meds which I end up doing. 

I left his clothes at 10pm. He finally arrived at 3am. After dropping his clothes off I go home and try to destress and eat (hadn't eaten all day and was actually still in my work uniform). I keep feeling as though I'd abandoned him and questioning whether or not I'd made the right choice.

He called me this morning extremely angry. Because of covid there are no visitations so to offset that the patients have near constant access to phones now.

He tells me that he hates me and his boss. He tells me that he told them not to tell me where he was going because he wanted nothing to do with me. (They did tell me, though).

My husband has a history of aggressive outbursts at me, his parents,  and even cashiers at stores.  He made a female cashier cry one time leaving me to calm her down. His best friend keeps trying to tell me that I should consider leaving him because he believes that hes emotionally abusive to me.

I've given all this information just to ask a few things:

n8dgc1,gxhyaq1,Where did I go wrong?,"I was lonely since secondary school with virtually no one to talk to since then. Well, had a high school friend with whom I hanged out once in two months, but since he found a girlfriend, we didn't.

Fun thing, I had my 18th birthday party together with him and another guy. We all invited the same number of people, but no one came to celebrate my birthday. So I sat in a dark corner, drinking beer alone for six hours straight. I have no grudge though, actually I'm glad they enjoyed it so it wasn't a complete failure. Still, then I realized how bad the situation was.

I once had a girlfriend. That is, until I found out she's been cheating on me. After she dumped me(!), she would keep sending me vids I don't want to remember - every other day.  
(Edit: she left the country, we're no longer in touch for few years already)

I don't trust my own shadow now and my self-esteem doesn't exist. I'm probably socially disabled now.

i1gf5n,fzxtpby,My sister is getting married tomorrow and I’m livid,"Over a hundred thousand people have died because of this virus. So many people have lost people they love and never got a chance to say goodbye. So many more people are going to lose their lives to it. In my town, less than half of people I see are wearing masks. No one is social distancing or staying at home now. Our parks and beaches have been at full capacity with no precautions being taken. We’ve have more positive cases everyday, there are people on ventilators in the ICU, people have fucking died. 

My sister got engaged during the beginning of the pandemic. She decided to get married this year. Over 150 people are attending, from all across the valley, in a small church with poor ventilation. They are going to be eating and drinking, in very close contact with each other. They said they are “trying to take precautions” by having pre-made plates for everyone, and that they will encourage people to wear masks. 

But like..... WHY do you NEED to have it this year?

My dad had pancreatic cancer since last March and he was last Monday hospitalized because of a stroke. I visited him and he was fucking miserable. But this wasn't enough. Turns out he had another stroke last night. A real fucking serious one. Me and my Two younger brothers visited him today in the hospital.

At first we weren't even allowed to visit him because of the Corona virus. Our family is of Algerian descent and the doc treating him is an Egyptian so we got some leniency and me and my siblings got to visit him. I have a medical background that's why I talked to the doc. My brothers visited him while I was talking to the doc. The doc said I'm the one to call the shots since I'm the oldest and closest relative, which basically means that I have to decide whether or not to shut down the machines.

I told him that I'll think about it tonight, but then I also had to tell my sister, who's seven years old, what's up with dad and how his chances are Really fucking bad.

Luckily my best friend chimed in to entertain her while  I got together with my mom to tell her what is going on.

I love my dad and I don't know whether or not to keep the machines running.

If i keep em running I might have to live without a dad and with the knowledge that I caused him immense pain.

hasw9k,g878wtc,Why does no one ever speak about the major memory loss that comes with depression?,"(I haven't been on this sub before so idk if it's discussed here more often or if it even happens to everyone but I have basically never heard of people talk about this aspect of depression) Seriously, before I had depression I didn't have the slightest idea that it would effect your memory and every time I mention my fucked up memory people are always suprised. I can't think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life. I can't explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff i've said or done and I can't properly remember it myself.

Edit: everyone probably doesn't have this and it's not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect. Like some people have said it all just blurs together. I think it has something to do with how you don't really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them. I mean I can't remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so don't know what's that all about but it's kind of a relief that im not alone with this.

Edit: it took me about 30 minutes (if not more) to read all of these comments. I didn't really read everyone all the way through or focuse on them but I tried to read them all.

frcfx6,flvn2s5,My mom is gone. What now?,"My mom has always been super flakey and has gone on benders, but normally they only last about a week. But its been almost three weeks and she hasn't come home yet and she took all her stuff when she left. I know that means that she isn't coming back but I don't want to go into foster care or anything because I just started high-school and if I'm in foster care I probably won't graduate. How do I keep afloat without tipping anyone off that she's gone?

Update: I was lucky enough to get a part-time job, ( I had one before as a maid but quarantine destroyed that) and am able to pay my bills. It's been going okay but COVID-19 has definitely made it harder than it normally would be. I haven't told anyone about my situation and I probably won't. My mom didn't really have many friends and we live in a small enough town that the school district just ignores her. The only person to ever actually get to know her is my best friend and his family but after he died last spring his family moved away. I'm doing fine though, just surviving.

&amp;#x200B;","&gt;How do I keep afloat without tipping anyone off that she's gone?

Your first priority should be keeping yourself safe, which may mean letting others know what's going on. Unfortunately I think you will have to, even if it means going into foster care. There are too many things that may come up that you need help with, like insurance, public assistance, taxes, utilities, etc. Also at some point won't someone ask where your mom is (does she have relatives, friends, etc.)? It would look weird if she's been missing but you didn't tell anyone for weeks/months.

gxv75g,ft5lqcc,"The ""new normal"" is giving me anxiety","Context: I'm living in Argentina. I live with my parents, they're not doing economically good even before all this. The country per se was not doing good. I'm one of the lucky ones who's still working hence receiving my full income.

At first I didn't like the quarantine, it disrupted my routine. I needed it to end soon. I cried at times, not because of the situation but many other issues. Now I got used to it and I'm relatively OK, as good as I can be. Now I realized I don't want it to end. Thinking of the ""new normal"" terrifies me. Am I the only one feeling this way?","I was in a very similar situation after being locked up for months, barely leaving the house. I was constantly in a pretty dark mood. Then the other day I had to go to the office to fetch a new computer (1 hr drive each way), and finally leaving the house for a longer time has given my moral a huge boost.

So, I don't know much about your situation, I don't know if you are allowed to leave your home in Argentina, but if you can, try to go out for a bit (while keeping safe ofc). It may not change anything about the ""new normal"", but it can boost your mood and make it easier to accept the changes.",0,2,0
id4nsd,g27c58h,This pandemic is ruining my life and I’m at the end of my rope,"I just needed to get this off my chest to someone. I know i am privileged and that there are many people in much worse shape than i. I haven’t lost anyone to covid but god damn has this year sucked. I lost my grandma when the pandemic was starting (old age, peacefully) and the same day i learned that my university was going all online the next week. I have adhd and online learning is hoRRIBLE for me i have no external pressures to get classes done but nonetheless i suffered through and even took two summer classes. I applied to grad school for spring semester and I’m so scared that i won’t get in. I don’t have a plan b for my life. 

I lost what was going to be one of my best semesters in school yet, my friends and i were are beginning to turn 21 and the weather was going to warm up soon and then i lost it all. I went home and thankfully i had my bf who i was able to see and we’ve spent a lot of time together these several months. But i fucking miss my apartment and my friends. My friends dislike my bf for made up reasons that i gave them evidence weren’t even true. They took it out on me and i lost the people who i thought i was closest to as they told me i was toxic and horrible. I have a few other friends but i couldn’t see any of them bc covid of course. I’m an extrovert and i live to hang out with friends in person. I’m so fucking lonely all the time and no, Skyping or zoom meetings with friends isn’t the same and frankly i just cancel a lot on people bc I’m losing my will to do anything. 

I lay in bed all day and do fucking nothing. I spent almost all my summer doing classes but otherwise i just lay here and sleep all day. I’ve never been so out of shape i used to love group exercise classes bc it forced me to workout with everyone around me. Watching a YouTube video isn’t the same at all. I picked up crochet as a hobby and that’s helped some but i would trade it in a heartbeat for some fucking human interaction other than my parents and bf. 

Schools starting again next week. I graduate in December. It’s my last semester of college and it’s a sham. Online classes are a sorry excuse for what they used to be and my school is charging full tuition and fees for things that are functionally cancelled like rec sports or the library. The only thing that has me holding on is my one in person class/lab and being back in my apartment. It’s a second home to me and i miss it so much it hurts i haven’t been since April. My class is extremely low risk as there are 6 students and it’s a very large classroom where we can sit far apart and everyone will wear masks. But this is too high risk according to my bf. He is adamant that me wanting to go back to school is immature and selfish. I’m not going to parties or bars or even hanging out with large groups of people. It’s not fucking fair i want my life back or whatever i can get and he wants me to throw it away. I miss my apartment i miss my roommates i miss my college town. I’m losing my college graduation I don’t want to lose my bf in this too. I love him and with all my friends ditching me he’s pretty much all i have. I can’t do this. 

If you didn’t read all this that’s fine but I’m falling apart and I’m losing everything it’s not fair i know life isn’t fair but fuck. I’m so sad i don’t even want to be alive there’s nothing good coming.

It's also easier to get stuck in certain emotional episodes which make everything overwhelming.

I know you were just venting, but my advice is to definitely go back to uni. It sounds safe, and you can add to that safety by regularly changing your mask. It's simply the environment you love while also offering you a social life and routine, and especially during these times those are three things you really need. Your boyfriend will have to think and realise that you're being responsible in adhering to all safety measures and not letting yourself slip into depression. Good luck!",1,2,0
ir26l2,g4w9t9n,How can I deal with everything and still force myself to “be fine”?,"Lately, I’ve been feeling really down so I really need to talk it out, but since I feel like it would be a burden for the people that I love, I’d rather just write it here.

I’m just... not okay. I hate how my life is right now but i can’t do anything to change it. I feel like I spend all of my time trying to prove people in my life that I am worth it, that I am enough. But at the end of the day, I always end up alone. My mom has always preferred my younger brother over me, since he was born. She never really took care of me, always left me at relatives homes when I was a kid, but then my brother was born, and it all became about him, and don’t get me wrong, my brother is probably the one person I love the most in this planet.
My dad is always away for work, I can never talk to him.
My best friend is always with her boyfriend, and I don’t want to be that person who ruins her fun with my own negativity, so I just meet her sometimes and pretend everything is fine
And the person I love is super far away and growing apart from me, I don’t even know what I have done wrong, he knows I really care about him and all of that, but I don’t think he understands how much I love him.
I just can’t deal with always being the accessory in everyone’s life. I wish I was someone’s favorite person. I wish everything I do to make other people feel good somehow made me feel the same way, but I just feel like I’m drowning and I have no one who I can call for help. I feel the loneliest I’ve ever felt in my life. And lately I just want to lay in bed, listen to music and just pretend I don’t exist","Hey, as a people pleaser myself, I can relate to how you feel. I want to be liked by everyone, or at least I want people to be neutral when they think of me. E.g. it feels good when you're invited to a party because it feels like you matter to someone which is nice.

Once I was one of the only women my ultimate frisbee team, who wasn't chosen to go to Nationals and I was gutted. They were going to Glasgow too and I longed to visit Scotland (still do). I felt left out and upset and compiled with the feelings of worthlessness and loneliness that were already there, I was about to quit playing...until about a week or two I was asked by the women's captain to play against a university. She also said that I'm improving a lot on short passes, cutting etc. I just needed to work on gameplay and being more familiar with zones. Now in hindset I realise, ""I really shouldn't let others dictate how I feel, whether that is happy or sad, because that is a stressful way to live."" 

Loneliness is an isolating feeling and can lead you to a slump. However being alone gives me time to rejuvenate myself, find new interests or finish something off and just learn more about yourself in general through reflection. I would say that's the difference between loneliness and being alone. One is not by choice whereas the other is or you make something good of yourself by taking time for yourself. To tell you another quick story, a good friend of mine forgot about my plans to go to the cinema and I was waiting after school for her to respond. After some time there was only me and another girl in the classroom and when I told her what's up, she said I can still go myself. And you know what, I did and I loved it. Her forgetting about the cinema had nothing to do with me (she was going through a rough time) and I didn't allow myself to feel pulled down by it. It was just so freeing. I wish I could be like that all the time but it's a work in progress.

So what I'm trying to say here is don't try to be someone's favourite person. Instead, be your best self and love who you are and what you have accomplished in life, even if those accomplishment may have been small. If anything, be your own favourite person. 

Plus, although I do understand not wanting to feel like a burden to people, I also do believe in a problem shared is a problem halved (most of the time). Telling your parents or best friends how you feel may help you to be one step closer to dealing with this situation you have. Your happiness matters just as much as anyone else's.

ha9b7c,fv1t6le,Young Men are basically screwed,"I know it's such a minor inconvenience compared to almost everything else everyone is going through right now, but I gotta say the future does not look particularly bright for anyone. 

I'm a 28yr old guy, great job, good social skills and a great paying job. I've been single for 2 years now, as my last relationship ended horribly. Long story short, I was cheated on and humiliated as it went on for ages and I had no idea, while everyone else did. 

Big deal, c'est la vie. So I decide not to date for a while to get my head straight. Then Covid strikes and honestly, I'm completely at a loss for how to connect with others. 

Tried the Internet dating junk, basically only received spam and fishy prospects. (Not bragging either but I'm a good looking guy, so it's not like my pics are awful or I'm hunting for hook ups). 

Basically, my consensus is this world is garbage. Not because I can't find a date if my life dependend on it (which I can't) but more so that what's the point? If the only way to connect with others is via dating app and meeting in person is a lost thing, what's left in this weird-post-pandemic world? Why should anyone care about a life where we have to be sheltered inside, away from others? 

I feel like this year has sorta solidified my belief that life in this geneeation is going to be a long, lonely struggle. There's no dreams of family or future anymore. No owning homes or being out of debt. Just surviving, staying locked inside to stare at a screen, asking you to watch more ads and pay more money. 

This is coming from a well-off, first world, privileged guy. Hard working and kind, but for what? Just seems like this generation, more than any generation, understands how futile this life truly can be. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. Not a threat to myself or anyone, just going on day 100-and something of feeling like this world has shown it's true colors and that there really isn't a whole lot for a young guy (or really anyone) to do.

Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

What they believe is that this is a different strain of the flu or any other naturally occurring virus, and that the numbers that normally would be attributed to the flu, etc are now being skewed to make it appear as though the 450,000 people that died would not have died otherwise. They believe that those people would have been part of the usual number of people that die every year, essentially making this pandemic look like an event of its own, separate of the death rate that we would see any other year. 

I think that looking at previous years’ numbers for flu deaths, pneumonia deaths, etc. in comparison to 2020’s numbers would help tell PART OF the tale. (Admittedly, I have not done that.)  But obviously this virus technically DOES EXIST. 

Again; this is not my viewpoint so don’t flame me; I just know a lot of people who subscribe to it.",0,0,0
g06yk3,fn84365,I dont know what to do.,"Hi, i just found this reddit, i never use reddit let alone post things about myself.

Im 31 years old, ill be 32 in May. Well over the past year, ive lost my child and the woman i love still to this day because of my own actions. I havent saw my daughter since last year in February. She refuses to let me see her. I lost my house in that area because the room mates i had couldnt even pay their part.I ended up losing my job there because i went into a spiral of ecstasy use. I was taking 10 or more pills everyday and just gave up. I ended up moving back to the area im from. I got a job here, but i was literally me too'd. Someone claimed harassment and instead of investigating, i was fired instead. Even though there was no proof and im not even that type of person to begin with. Next the bat soup virus hit.Every shop/store around me has closed down. I filed my income tax, and it was seized by debt collectors, all $1038 of it. We're supposed to get a stimulus check, but after reading that its not safe from private collectors, it will probably be gone too.

I really dont know what to do now, I've contemplated this for a long time, even before i moved away from where my children are. i think im going to do it. I mean, im out of money, cant get a job, and the renter is still demanding rent payments.I dont have any friends anymore, due to me cutting everyone out of my life due to depression.

Im at my wits end, and I'm not sure how much longer im gonna try to keep going.  


  
(if you were wondering. No, i didnt cheat on her. I was abusive. I took classes and got help for it.)","It must be awful feeling like that, and having little to no chance of getting out of the situation anytime soon. I really hope that your life takes a turn for the better soon",1,2,0
hochzc,fxhjxfi,I am one month sober.,"I (25f) realized about 3 years ago I had a drinking problem, but at 22 I thought I was too young to quit drinking. I would miss so many social situations, or at least that was my excuse. 

After college I moved 3,000 miles away from my family and friends. At first drinking was my way to meet people in my new state, but then I would continually fall into cycles of shutting myself in and drinking alone for weeks on end, not going to my hiking group or seeing anyone. But I would always bounce back. I would tell myself, I stop drinking for now. It's just a break. A break will make the problem better. 

Quarantine changed that. With COVID, and I was left on my own even more since I couldn't go into work. My hiking group shut down. To deal with my loneliness I started drinking more and more. To the point I was drinking a big bottle of rum a week plus wine and beer. I gained weight. I became lazy and lethargic due to constant hangovers. I was disgusted and hated myself. 

I couldn't tell anyone this as I was so embarrassed. I wasn't ready to admit it.  I was in denial. I can't be an alcoholic. I am too young. I can't quit now, what about traveling? What about parties? What about my friends weddings? What about my wedding? 

One month ago today I admitted to myself. It is a problem. I am an alcoholic. 

One month ago today I realized that every time I have been happy with myself was when I wasn't drinking. I realized every time I have lost weight, and been in great shape, I wasn't drinking.

One month ago today I finally did it. I poured all of all the alcohol in my house down the sink and gave it all up.

 I am so proud of myself, but I can't tell anyone because no one knows I had a problem. No one knows how bad it really was.

The urges and cravings are still there. But I am strong enough now to say no. 

This isn't just a now thing. It is not just another round in the endless cycle. I am not going to let it be. I am ready for this to be the rest of my life. I am free.","You are doing great.

I’m so sick of the constant noise in my ears, and then on top of that, I guess god desires to take away the only reason why I’m still alive. I have nothing left to live for. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this out. The most depressing thing about this is the fact my parents are going to have to walk into my bedroom and see me in a pool of my own blood.

fjnw3m,fko0hh7,Suddenly anxious at work and it's making me hate everyone and everything.,"In the past, I would be all smiles and excited to go to work with all of my coworkers. We've all seemed to get a long pretty well with no problems. Recently I've had some bad days with no known cause of what exactly is triggering these problems but I have a feeling it may have something to do with cliques in the workplace. It seems like recently I've been left out of most conversations now, no one really talks to me unless they absolutely need something and I'm left to do whatever I can by myself.

This has been going on for a few weeks now and I'm sure it's making this depression worse because they use to be my escape anytime I would have issues. My work has gotten sloppy and I simple don't want to wake up in the mornings anymore.

I understand that I really shouldn't care what other people think -or may think- about me, but I overthink everything and care pretty deeply about how people see me, unfortunately. Does anyone have any recommendations as to what I can do to get away from this feeling?

jxdsin,gcydv9n,My mother is the 1%. She has a name.,"We got one of those Front Steps Projects photos done in late April. My husband and I, and our dog, too. We thought it would be a nice memory of the quarantine, which would be a short, unique event. 

What you don't know is that less than 10 minutes before the picture was taken I received a phone call that my mother had tested positive for covid.  

17 days later she was gone.

My adult relationship with my mother was strained. This does not make her passing any less personal.  I'm working through the grief with a therapist.

This pandemic has become so irreparably polarizing and politicized. I do genuinely understand that stay-at-home orders are negatively affecting businesses, working parents, school children, seniors and that mental health issues are on the rise. I trust the numbers, the scientists and the guidance that, until there is widespread distribution of a vaccine, we need to do our part to stop the spread and prevent more deaths. There will be consequences and collateral damage, unfortunately.

People dismiss it as nothing more than the flu. Covid-19 has killed 6x more people in a shorter period than the flu does annually, if you trust the numbers, which I do. People are dismissing anything deemed “complications from covid” as a non-covid death inflating the numbers. The fact remains that had that person not gotten covid, they wouldn’t have gotten the complication they succumbed to, like my mother. 
You’re being dismissive on a technicality and missing the point. If she hadn’t gotten covid, she wouldn’t have died. Period. End of story.

Some people aren't interested in taking measures that might prevent further spread of this highly infectious virus, assuming that it won’t affect them or anyone around them. People think stay at home, small groups and social distancing requests are communism at work. Or that masks aren’t manly or that they are a political statement. This breaks my heart. This is not communism-this is community. This is humanity trying to come together to save lives. 

I have to wonder what your thought process is or what your moral fiber is that you wouldn’t want to help your neighbor with a simple gesture like a mask or social distancing.  People assert that we shouldn't take it so seriously because there is such a low mortality rate at just 1%. How insensitive.

That 1% is my mother. That 1% is a human being. Two hundred fifty thousand human beings, in fact. When you throw those statements around you are diminishing Sharon's life and my grief. 

We teach our children to be kind and compassionate. Adults could and should lead by example.

Reframe your thinking, please, and put a name on your numbers before you use them to defend your ignorance or not doing your part. That 1% is Sharon Shaughnessy: proud Irish lass from Roxbury, Mass, mother of four, grandmother of five and lover of fresh Dunkins coffee. Sharon's seat at the table is empty this year. 

Nate wanted to cancel the photoshoot but I forged ahead. Given this was our #FrontStepsProject photo shoot capturing pandemic quarantine, it seemed sadly fitting. When I see this photo now I don’t see Nate or Doug; I see my mother. I see the words said to me that day and over the following 17:

“I’m sorry, your mother has tested positive.” 

“I’m sorry, we have to transport your mother to the hospital.”

“I’m sorry, she is not improving. She now has pneumonia.”

“I’m sorry, you need to make a decision about hospice. Yes, we can make an exception for you to see her in person.”

“Sally, we’re too late. She’s gone.”

Be kind. Be thoughtful with your words. Wear a mask. Do your part. I don’t wish this on anyone.

gvhtx3,fszeyam,Black Protest Support Megathread and Community-Wide Guidelines,"The [Black-led protests](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) are now worldwide. America's racial problems are well-documented, and there are many that continue to deny it. Let us make clear this community is explicitly [anti-racist](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/talking-about-race/topics/being-antiracist) as embodied in Rule 2. [If ""Black Lives Matter"" is a controversial statement to you](https://twitter.com/scarecrowbar/status/1268622278109155329/photo/1), you are not empathic and not a good fit to provide support here. However, we acknowledge not everyone is up to speed on this discussion, so we are providing some information and setting specific guidelines in navigating this topic.

OffMyChest is a support community. People come here to post their issues and our community members provide emotional support only. We do not allow soapboxing; posters must make it evident they are describing a personal issue (see Rule 3). For Black people, this protest and everything related to it is inherently personal, they are fighting for their lives. They are exempt from the megathread. The community has already shown they understand this and we thank you.

This megathread exists for everyone else to show support for the protests, and to get support for their efforts toward that end. The issues being protested are inherently part of providing support. Keep in mind, Black people's lives are not an abstract debate to them, don't tell them what they should or shouldn't be doing to self-determine their liberation.

With regards to **property**, we are not tolerating discussion of inanimate objects. They are insured and can be rebuilt and replaced. To bring this up [in the context of what is happening to people's lives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/31/my-familys-restaurant-caught-fire-protests-let-it-burn-oppressive-systems-with-it/) is not supportive.

With regards to **violence**, [property cannot be subject to violence](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/06/why-property-destruction-isnt-violence/). We are not tolerating discussion of violence as it pertains to the protest unless it critiques the inherent violence in the institutional structures and militarized response being protested.

Regarding **looting**, again, property is insured. We must make sure to [empathize with looting as a transition to freedom](https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2003/04/11/Rumsfeld-Looting-is-transition-to-freedom/63821050097983/), but recognize there are [white supremacists](https://www.businessinsider.com/3-boogaloo-men-terror-charges-george-floyd-protest-riot-conspiracy-2020-6) and [organized crime](https://abcnews.go.com/US/nypd-detectives-actively-hunting-looters-vandals-george-floyd/story?id=71036694) taking advantage of it. Federal law enforcement is on the case so there is little to say or do. Keep the focus on the issues, not the methods of protest.

With regards to societal **solutions**, this is not the focus of a support community but it is going to come up. You must first understand [the problem with policing in America](https://youtu.be/km4uCOAzrbM). Second, we as individuals are generally not policymakers. Our function as citizens is to make the problems a priority such that policymakers are compelled to develop solutions and politicians are compelled to pass and fund it. Understand that ""abolishing/defunding the police"" is [a slogan for restructuring law enforcement in society](https://www.vox.com/2020/6/3/21276824/defund-police-divest-explainer). Here is [a catalog of research-based solutions](https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224).

This protest isn't just about police, it's about the state of Black people in America, which is beyond the scope of this post to explain. If you are not [equipped with the knowledge](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1) to provide support in a productive way we ask that you tread judiciously.

With regards to **performativity**, anti-racism is as much of a commitment to a lifetime personal journey as it is delivered through your actions. The issues being protested are immense and require a sustained long-term effort to address, so what matters most is what you will be doing a year from now.

No police worship. This is a systemic issue, it is not about individuals. Defense of individual police is effectively a defense of the system being protested, don't do it.

I think it hurts too much to let it all out here. But I was peacefully protesting in Seattle last Saturday in front of city hall.

huelq2,fyqcvjm,I am a Amazon delivery driver and was tested positive for Covid.,"I have been a delivery driver for amazon since the beginning on 2020. I recently (7/16) tested positive for covid and am now in full quarantine, yet my boss is charging me AWOL for not coming into work. I have provided him the test results and even contacted my doctor who verified it and forward the message to him and still says that im able to work.

I deliver between 150-200 packages daily, 5 days a week within 60-70 miles from our station. That's potentially 1000+ people i could effect in one week just by BEING in the van with the packages. I have absolutely no idea where he is getting this idea for me to risk other peoples lives just for him to profit more.

EDIT: Wake up and see this has blow up. Thank you all for your comments but its going to take some time for me to respond.

For those saying i am now an Amazon employee, I applied through amazon, joined through amazon, work as amazon and drive the branded amazon ford transit and mercedes-benz sprinter vans. The only difference is that i am under the charge of a DSP who is under contract for 1 year at the station i work at. Nothing about this is clickbait and im sorry you think that it is. Im just getting things ""off my chest"" because i have one 2 people to tell IRL and it bothers me a lot that my boss is seemingly allowed to do this.

EDIT 2: More of a Disclaimer for claritiy sake. 

I in no way feel this is a reflection of Amazon as a company. I have been directly employed by amazon, but ""leased"" to different DSPs working out of the station. My issue is with the current DSP i am under and the inaction of the people i have recently reported him to. 

Side note: We all know of bosses that do shady/cruddy things but don't get reprimanded. That is all im looking for here, not to tarnish anyone or ""cancel"" anything. I just want people to just be more human you know?   ",What is a DSP?,0,0,2
k7mxc8,gewerng,"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

The article is called A Long-Lost NASA Spacecraft Rises From the Dead.

I also thought of this quote """"We wanted the best, but it turned out like always."" because it is sometimes misquoted as going ""We hoped for the best, but it turned out like always."" It wasn't about making friends. I think it might have been about the Russian economy.

After the exam was performed there were some discrepancies between what the patient said and what her ordering physician said we were looking at. Our EHR system is shared with the dr so I take a look to see how this testing came to be ordered and come across a message from yesterday where the patient called that office to inform them they tested positive for COVID on January 4th. This appointment was made on January 7th. So they knew they were positive and had active symptoms when they made the appointment. They lied to us when scheduling (our policy is to ask if they’ve tested positive or have had known exposure within the last two weeks), they lied to me on the phone yesterday when I asked the same prescreening questions AND AGAIN lied to the screeners at the door when asked the same questions. Not only did they have the audacity to lie to three different people on three different occasions they then proceeded to REMOVE THEIR MASK IN THE LOBBY to talk on the phone for at least 15 minutes.

Do you think I am overreacting about the hospital? I am afraid that if I go to the hospital, my situation will be worse when I get discharged. I will just have missed more work.

I sleep every other night because the only time I can get myself to do anything at all is in the middle of the night. 

I am spinning out.

Haven’t tried Strattera.","I would reccomend checking yourself in somewhere, let work know you are taking time off to deal with a medical issue and then focus on yourself until you feel better.

I try to designate a specific time to sit down and do it but the deadline comes and goes and I still haven't done anything.

We tried some drugs and medicines that worked so well for him that I don’t understand how come it’s not helping me. Not just him but so many people with their experiences. I used to smoke weed all the time and it felt nice and a good release. But now, I still enjoy smoking, but I don’t feel anything anymore. Yes I’m high I can feel that, but I can’t feel the dopamine it use to give me or the excitement that came with it. Now I just smoke weed like it’s cigarettes. Ive tried cigarettes before. It just gave me migraines. I don’t drink bc who tf likes being sick after that shit? I’ve done mushrooms before. It was fun while I was on it the first couple times and I did think about a lot of things that I thought would hold, but no. Now honestly the most things I got from shrooms is I feel like we live in a simulation lmao. But the last time I did them, it wasn’t the same and bc mushrooms are much more intense than weed I don’t rlly want to just up the dosage to see if it’ll help. I also don’t want to do LSD bc I genuinely think I’ll kill myself if I’m on acid. But since I didn’t want to end up doing heavy things like coke or heroin, I tried my boyfriends ADHD meds. Ritalin would make me rlly hyperactive and it made my OCD symptoms 10 times worse. So I had to smoke to alleviate the effects. On Adderall, I felt happiness in a way I never felt before. It wasn’t temporary happiness because I got paid or because I’m talking about something I like. It felt like genuine contentment, my hyperactivity calmed, I wasn’t overthinking, and my compulsions weren’t overwhelming, and I just felt okay. Enjoying my time with my boyfriend. The first and second time I took 30mg. I felt happy at first but eventually I was so trapped in myself. And for a second I just wanted to take more Adderal bc it was wearing off, but that’ll lead to addiction. Even meds prescribed for exact issues fail me. The closes thing I got to helping me function is Fluoxetine, and I was prescribed that for my depression and OCD. Eventually that stopped working too. It’s like I can’t be fixed with medications legal and illegal. And I refuse to turn to addiction, because addiction runs in my family and I’ve seen it ruin lives. But my life is already being ruined because my brain wants to die.

Just hoping that I can find another way before it’s too late for me.

that dreadful horrible time before falling asleep is the scariest. At that time there are no defenses, no distractions to protect me from myself.

g241h3,fnod4wu,I told my parents about my depression and their reaction was not what I thought.,"So a little background. I'm 15 year old boy, living in a small city with my both parents and my 16 year old sister. Ok let's get to the main point.

When my sister was 15 years old, she was depressed and she had attempted suicide, and my parents got her to a psychologist and shortly after that she was going to a psychiatrist, and she got anti-depressants. And now she's off of them.

About like 8 months or more ago, I told my mom to not tell my dad what I'm about to tell her, and she said ok, so I told that I've been feeling sad, suicidal shortly depressed, and that I've been like hearing my voice in my head to just call it quits and just kill myself, and my mom told my dad which then got through the whole family, but I was not going to any psychologist, neither psychiatrist.

And recently I've harmed myself which led me to a psychologist, and I've been going there for a while now, but recently my nudes was published through out my whole school and I wasn't going to my school and shortly after that I went to my psychologist and she gave me this like depression test, which I've answered how I actually felt, and she recommended to go to a psychiatrist to get my anti-depressants written off so I could buy them, but what pissed me off even more is that my parents knew that I got recommended to go to a psychiatrist and they said ok to that, and I was told that I'm gonna go to a psychiatrist with my sister (she had to do like a check for depression), but I did not go there, not because I did not want to, but because my mom did not even tell me to get dressed etc. and when my parents and I got to my psychologist my parents told that I was ok, when I heard that, in my head I was like ""Ok, you don't actually know how I feel, cause I always smile and pretend to be happy and not tell the actual truth"".

Probably no one is gonna read through all of that, but if you read through it all then what should I do? I've been feeling even more depressed lately, and my dad says like why the fuck should you be depressed about.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I've been having those like mental breakdowns where I would just lay on my bed, face on the pillow, and just listen to sad/depressed songs and just cry. I've been wanting to kill myself more then before. I don't know what to do. I've started not trusting anyone, not even myself.","So, the reason why I don't talk to my sister, cause she does the same thing, if I tell her that I'm feeling depressed, she just says ""Why the f*ck are you supposed to be depressed about"" and stuff like that.

ihesqz,g2zq5j6,Living with Brother during Covid; He Drinks too much.,"Hi. I'm not sure what I think about this....  we are both in our 30's, he's my older brother. We live together during Covid.

I noticed a trend where on any given night, once 5-6 oclock hits, he wants to go get beers or stop into a local bar (which has outdoor seating) and ""have a couple of beers"" ""have some fun"" ""relax, its a nice day."" Sometimes I will join, sometimes I won't. Every time I do, the ""two beers"" promise never survives the night. Even when I tell him ahead of time I'll go if its for a couple, he'll order more once we finish.. Inevitably he'll end up having 6+ drinks by himself, one way or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its frustrating, because I hate seeing the ""if 1 is good, 2 is great!"" mentality at work... something about that pisses me off on a visceral level. That's my problem. Additionally, I feel like I can't really say anything. Its not really destructive in an overt way, and he's not coming home fall down drunk. Its a number of beers that many people would expect to have if they went out, or maybe after a full day of work.

But its enough that he's properly drunk by the end of it, and I don't like the idea that he seems to not be able to stop at 2. He, WITHOUT FAIL, wakes up the following day and the first thing out of his mouth is ""....eh. I drank too much last night""

I don't know. I feel foolish even bringing it up. Like it's too small of a problem to put labels on. And maybe i'm just projecting my own shit- I have hangups about allowing myself to get inebriated outside of social situations. I dunno. Been bothering me, and I don't know how to say anything that will be productive, or not come out as holier than thou.","Whether it seems like a small problem or not, he is definitely showing signs of alcoholism. There isn’t anything you can really do to help, because he needs to recognize that this is a problem and be willing to work on it.

I get it, I've struggled with depression for a lot in my life and I still do but instead of feeling bad for myself I work through my problems. I know people who legitimately have PTSD, Bi-Polar, etc.

But none of it is an excuse to gaslight people, to treat people like garbage, and to have horrible behavior. It's up to you to keep yourself in check and if you can't, remove yourself from a situation when you know that you're going to go off the wall.

When I'm in a depressive state, I don't hang out with people because I know I'll bring people's attitude's down with me, so I work on it myself.

I 100% support people who are trying to get help with mental illnesses but if you have one and use it as an excuse to treat people terribly you are a horrible person and are either faking said mental illness or using it for attention. And in either way you are a piece of shit.

Don't have a victim mentality, get help instead.","Really needed to hear this ❤️

Currently isolating with my family, including my brother who was diagnosed with depression (I'm unsure to what degree), anger management issues and occasionally suicidal thoughts, all relating to a trauma which occurred in childhood.

A little background: He has received counselling on and off for years, more off than on and currently off, and refuses to take any medication he was offered or prescribed, as he believes he counselling is the best solution for him.

I am living with my own issues with anxiety and depression so I understand to an extent when he has an episode. In the past I have been the person he has turned to during an episode, or just to talk through his thoughts and I have  also talked him down from attempting suicide.

Recently I have noticed how the isolation is affecting his mood and he has become more aggressive, irritable and abusive than ever. When I call him out on his behaviour, an argument ensues and he threatens suicide or to harm one of us or will say something along the lines of ""how do you think this is making me feel?! "". In the last few weeks he has threatened to drown me in the lake by our house and to burn our house down. 

After reading your post OP, I don't feel alone anymore and I know I'm right in calling him out on his bullshit. His behaviour is NOT acceptable or justifed by his mental illness.

g1rww2,fni7exu,WOW. I'm disappointed in my friends after discussing my mental state with them and telling them about my self harm.,"Background: Went into treatment at 17 for anorexia, used to cut myself, continued the cutting until I was 19 and on medication. I was self harm free for a couple of years, relapsed at 22, went back to therapy. I'm now 26, and have been eating under 500 calories for the past 2 weeks, and self harmed again after a binge episode. I know my routine. I'm too old for this shit. I know what I'm doing, and it's even worst, because I know. 

I'm... reasonably well off and smart and educated woman. I have no reason to be this fucked up, and a friend of mine in a group chat brought up how miserable I was sounding. I started pouring my heart out, and talked about the things I've been experiencing and how I don't do anything... and they flipped out. They said my thoughts were moronic, and they were angry with me for even speaking like that! One of them said she was embarrassed. 

These are my only friends left. If I lose them, I'll have no one. No one to talk to, and I can't handle that. I want to change, but... I'm just not in the mood to work on it. My therapist gave me his personal number, since we can't meet up in person... but I don't wanna call. I'm scared. But I'm just very disappointed in my friends. That truly broke my heart.","I’m so sorry you’re struggling :( I always wondered why I was so fucked up, and it took work and therapy for me to realize I had been idealizing my childhood, and I actually didn’t receive unconditional love as a child (it was dependent on my good behavior.) My father used to force me to eat when I wasn’t hungry. Both my parents are very narcissistic. They never beat or molested me, and gave me lots of financial support. But emotional neglect is SO much more damaging than most people will give it credit for. 

I do have to concur that those don’t sound like friends. “Your thoughts are stupid”?? REALLY? How fucking invalidating can you be!? Friends are supposed to support one another when going through tough times. When I was in high school and opened up about my suicidal thoughts, a “friend” said “but you don’t have a reason to be depressed.” You don’t need a reason.

j9g6bd,g8jjoxk,I’m kind of lost in life and never really thought I would,"Hello Reddit,

Right now it’s about 1 AM while im writing this post. Perhaps to get shit off my chest, perhaps to get advice; I don’t really know. Maybe I get some insights.

I’m a 26 year old guy from The Netherlands, and currently rather unhappy with how things develop (and have developed) through my lifetime. 
For starters, till my 21th I didn’t care about anything besides gaming. It’s not that I feel bad about having gamed for so long in that period, it’s just that I reap what I’ve sown back then. For example, the friends I had were only gamers (as expected). I can’t go out with em, they barely wanna hang out, and the only times I speak to them is when I game myself. I don’t have a lot of people where I can randomly hang out with when I’m bored. There are some people I do hang out with at events, but I never talk to them otherwise. To summarize: a lot of acquaintaces. It’s not even that I’m very shy in that sense. It’s just that I can’t seem to bond with people, or I have to do all the effort to keep in touch with people.
Second, because I didn’t socialize for so long, you can probably guess I never had a relationship at all. The most I got was a date here and there, and that’s it. The girls I felt a connection with, were either taken or not interested. Swiping sometimes at dating apps, but without any succes. I just feel like a complete failure in that sense. Because I have shit experience, I don’t have the guts to just randomly talk to some chick. Perhaps for a chit-chat, but not more than that. Especially in COVID-times, I just feel the need for someone. Whether it’s a soulmate or some good friends to crack some beers with and listen to some music.
Besides that, I’ve always had trouble with figuring out what I want to do in life. This has been the case since high school. I just picked whatever direction required the least effort, and was somewhat ‘okay’. After I was done with High School, I studied history, but quit after not even a year. I gave a try at IT (cuz hell I just gamed my life away anyway, why not choose something computer relevant). I finished the bachelor, but I came to find out I did the whole study on auto-pilot and the technology didn’t interest me two flying fucks. I’m now again at a point where I don’t know what I wanna do. I mean, I’m a geek. I do like tech gadgets, some games and in my freetime I DJ/Produce stuff on an amateur basis, but business tech bores me to death. I want to do something else, but I’m clueless as fuck. I have figured out I wanna work with people, but that’s way too broad. I just don’t know where to start. 
I’ve been thinking of going abroad. Maybe drop all my stuff here, take a ticket to London and just give it all a new start. Due to COVID I don’t even know what’s possible and this may just be an impulsive idea. 
Thing is, I feel like I’m wasting my time away in my mancave, without any friends to connect to, without any soulmate, without any stimulus to my working ambitions. I feel like a fucking shell that’s on repeat.

Anyways, if you’ve made it to this point, thank you for reading my rant. I’ll be going for some sleep now because it’s another very bright monday tommorow. This gloomy weather ain’t working at all as well.

gbr3ve,fp8we2e,My Mom,"I lost my healthy strong mother to COVID 19 on April 10 - Good Friday, she was 74 years of age, 1 month away from her 75th birthday which is May 10 (Mother's Day) which I am dreading.

My mother was not lacking prayers, God heard us, sometime He says no because He always think of the best interest of the person and sees the bigger picture.  My sister is a mess, she lost her bestie.

mbay9m,grx5rgv,"My Life, My Story and The Effects of Extreme Childhood Abuse (CONTENT WARNING)","I'm just gonna give a HUGE Content Warning for anyone that has suffered extreme childhood abuse. So, Please click away if you feel like this may be triggering or harmful to your mental health.   


I'm not even sure where to being. So I guess I will just start by saying that I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for many year. My first time I ever really remember wanting to kill myself was around the age of 7, during what can only now be described as a routine round of prolonged torture at the hands of my parents and the outlaw motorcycle gang they belonged to.   


During these multi hour torture session, My siblings and myself, along with other children of the gang members were raped and beaten on camera. Many other things went on, including the torture/murder of animals on film, and I also now suspect that at least a few woman were murdered on film as well. At least 3 of the Police Officers in the town I grow up in were in the gang and participated in the child molestation/sex trafficking/child pornography ring.  


Lets fast forward a bit, through abusive relationships, my fairly troubled teenage years and drugs addiction, to the part where I am now an adult. Many years have gone by, my parents separated, we moved to a large city. It's been about 30 years since all those things had taken place. I just desperately wanted to forget about this trauma. I wanted more than anything to just feel fucking normal.   


I started seeing a therapist for my chronic suicidal thoughts and 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Before, I suffered from erratic mood swings and impulsivity. I needed to know why I felt this way and I needed to know why my parents felt like it was OK to hurt us so fucking horribly.   


Both at separate times gas lit me. Told me I was ""crazy"" that I actually had a wonderful childhood. My father told me he did the best he could and it was all my mother's fault if anything happened at all.  


Her response was basically the same. Denial and blame shifting minus the ""doing the best"" bullshit, blaming anything that happened on my father, if it happened at all.  


Well, they are both dead now. My father passed away last year from Emphysema and my mother passed away last month from Covid. They both suffered long and painful deaths alone with no one around them. I thought that their deaths would bring me some closure to the pain they put me through but, to tell you the truth: It didn't. It didn't help one fucking bit.  


Well now I am a fairly successful content creator. I honestly have 0 reason to complain. I have a nice house, everything I could want in life..... but always in the back of my mind, the torture is there. The memories play in my head like a projector. I often feel disgusted, but I have to wear a mask so the world doesn't get to see the real me.  


Recently, I have been toying around with the idea of shooting myself on livestream with no warning to those viewing. No one knows this except my best friend in real life and I don't know if he actually understands that I am serious. Our friend, his former best friend, took his own life 3 years ago in January via shotgun. And even though I know it hurt him and I saw the devastation it caused, and it did help my curb the thoughts cuz it was like, we saw him the night he killed himself, then the next day.... he's just gone. but I also realize that people move on, its been a while and our friend almost never comes up in conversation.   


This last month has been fairly hard for me. It's like I can't shake the idea. I lay in bed at night and I envision all the different ways my head could come apart. How the slug will exit. how it might feel. how bad will it hurt? I'm angry at myself for wanting to do this. but the more I get upset, the more I want to do it, its just a really bad cycle.  


I'm not ""sad' I'm just empty.  


Please, Don't hurt children or animals. It has effects that last for a lifetime  


thanks you for letting me vent,","I totally don't understand these people. By far the most evil people on earth and I truly hope they are completely annihilated in life and beyond.

mku0bq,gtioe7q,During the first three months of school three girls of my school passed away,"I live in a country where schools start around the second week of september. I'm a seventeen years old girl so I'm in high school.
The first half of 2020 was the roughest for everyone, but for me and for many other people in my town the last three months were devastating.
The day before the first day of school (in which there are 1880 students), in september 2020, one of my best friends died in a car accident while going at the beach with her boyfriend, and close friend of mine, who luckily survived. I was and am devastated. My friends are devastated. Her funeral was four days later, and nearly 2k people participated. She was involved in sports, girl scouts, social activities and she was one of the most outgoing and happy girl I've ever met. Her house became my second house during last summer, and i couldn't believe i finally found a friend like her, since I've ever struggled with opening myself in close friendships.

The morning after her accident we all went to school. Seeing our friends was terrible. I saw in their eyes myself, my emotions and what I was feeling and I hope I will never see someone I love in these condition, it was just terrible, as if what we were feeling inside wasn't enough.

Some weeks passed and we started facing the new routine without her. Waking up was difficult but somehow we managed to do it just to see each other at school and feel the warmth of someone who really understands you. We were restarting our lives slowly until in november one girl in our school died of respiratory insufficiency (she suffered from asthma). She had our same age, we didn't know her but this destroyed us. We felt like we were back in september. We started to talk to the people who knew this girl and supported each other because we knew what they were feeling. it was like re-living the loss of my best friend again.

December started and this happened again. A girl who lived across the streets from my boyfriend's house, who was just 15, was murdered from her father as a revenge for the fact that her mother decided to divorce from him. She was from our school as well and the atmosphere in our school was terrible. I noticed that various teachers, who knew two or ever all the three girls that passed away had often an absent look on their face, I wantes so bad to just go there and hug them, but for the pandemic we couldn't.

It was just like someone decided that losing a friend one time at seventeen wasn't enough. I HAD to relive it three times. Those months are by far the worst period of my life and no one, not my friends, not their parents, should experience something like this.

I fully became atheist because of this. I could not believe that someone actively planned our life to be like this. It would be so cruel.

(English is my second language. It is possible that I made mistakes because of this)

Laying a couch, playing music as loud as my earphones let me so I can drown my thoughts and prevent myself from crying. Thinking about my best friend as she goes another month without texting me and the last response is ""I'm a bit sick"". With this COVID, losing a family member last month, bills building up at home, smoking and getting high isn't helping. I don't have much friends because I kept to myself which seems to backfire. I never went to family. I scarcely went to my friends. I don't want to go to a therapist and don't want to validate my suicidal thoughts by calling s hotline.

I have a friend, who had been suffered for depressive disorder more than 10 years.
He had felt depression since he was 9 years old and it ended when he was 22 years old. He got some counselings.

I met him in college, and I remember he told me he want to kill himself when he was drunken.
I am glad he is now good and doesn't want to commit suicide anymore.

But he has always been an introverted man, and do not like to socilize with people. He doesn't talk his mind often to his friends. And i know he is not going to counselor anymore.

I am worried that depressive disorder can recur.

I am a medical student and learned some medicines that is prescribed for depressive disorder, but don't know the prognosis. But I heard some patients saying that they are worried of recurrence.","It can recur. Some depression is situational and some is chronic. If your friend was depressed from 9 to 22, I really doubt he was ""cured"" of it after so long, with only some counselling.

I don’t know if it’s why my work ethics is so good compared to them, but i’m determined to exceed financially. I try not to think about it but it kind of bothers me. Guess it’s the voice in my head telling me there’s always room for improvement.","I worked with a bunch of snobby not very rich kids. It got to me in the end. I grew up blue collar or working class or whatever it is called when your dad is a janitor and your mom works in a deli. My upbringing was very stable though, dinner at 5 pm, always in the same house, bills were always paid. My parents had a small farm and we even had a horse for years and years. BTW- horses are cheap when you bail your own hay. Anyway, I went to university, grad school and lived abroad teaching English in two different countries over six years. I traveled around Asia. I did this all on my own dime, without any parental support at all. n 

I came back to the US in 2011, unaware that we had developed a caste system. I started working at my alma mater in international education. My coworkers were strange. They thought I was poor. Like on welfare poor. I have never been on welfare or SNAP or even unemployment. They would become irrationally upset about my experiences, stating that I lied about having a degree, living abroad, etc etc. They were especially upset when they found out I had a Jacuzzi tub and a walk in closet in my house.

i1szdi,g00tzmg,The abuse of essential workers needs to stop.,"I have dealt with a lot of insanity since this pandemic started, but I think yesterday took the cake.

I’m a 23 year old female. I work at a grocery store. Yesterday, a man refused to wear a mask because he has asthma. I told him I would not ring up his groceries until he put it on. He did, but not without raising his voice at me and telling me he had already called his lawyer and we were all being sued.

Then, at closing time, a woman was wearing her mask around her neck. I asked her (very nicely, seriously) to please pull it up when she comes through the line. She nodded and pulled it up. When I got off, she drove by me in the parking lot screaming “fuck you!” over and over. Then she pulled up next to me at a red light and screamed more. I *highly* regret not taking a video of her. That’s really the only thing about that interaction that’s bothering me. That I didn’t get her face on video. 

I am just trying to do my job and not bring this virus home with me. I’m just trying to ring up your groceries and protect myself and my family. I can not believe America’s response to this virus. I’ve seen so much ugly, and it’s so disheartening.","I'm also an essential worker but at a cookie factory so I don't deal with verbal abuse but I understand people that wearing the mask isn't fun. I have to wear one 8 hours a day and can only take it off during my break time which is 15 minutes, 30 minutes and another 15 minutes. Since it's boiling hot now, the factory is boiling hot too and it's exhausting to breathe sometimes when I'm constantly moving around.

People shouldn't harass you or anybody else if they ask customers to put a mask on, if someone tells you to put a mask on, just please do it but harassing at the workers about it isn't going to help stop the virus. Believe me, whoever is an essential worker has probably heard their co-workers complaining about the masks, a customer would only have to wear it for an hour at least but an essential worker has to wear it for hours. 

Nobody likes the masks but please wear it to keep essential workers safe and those around you safe. I also agree with you about how America responded to the virus, seeing things like some Americans believe it's fake, how many more people have to die from covid for some Americans to see that the virus is real? Sadly, a lot of people have died from it and it's awful if it happens to your loved ones or to yourself. 

My hometown has made it mandatory to wear masks inside stores as of early July but I wore masks inside when it wasn't mandatory, covid started spreading more into my area around March and I started wearing the masks at work as of April. I wear it because I care, I don't like the masks but I'm also not selfish.",0,2,0

keoeqt,gg5ev2m,I don't understand how people can tolerate working full time,"I have been unemployed for about a year now after finishing my bachelor's degree. Soon I will move together with two friends and need to find a job. 
Thru covid there aren't to many offers and I don't seem to find or can even think about anything that doesn't seem to suck. Full time jobs are probably the only option if I don't want to do a shitty underpaid part time job that leaves me with next to no money. But just the thought about working 40h a week drives me insane. I fell like I can't do this. Two times I already worked in full time jobs and while the work was ok and my colleges were nice I absolutely hated it simply because of how time consuming it was. Working this much left me with pretty much no time or energy to do anything else. My social life suffered, I did less sport, had no time/energy for hobbies, it made me feel empty. 
The weird thing is that so many people just tolerate this shit. I see it with many friends, their social circle shrinks more and more and they barley have time left for hobbies. They say their jobs are fine but everytime I pay attention it seem like they are stressed, exhausted and it's nothing they truely enjoy doing. I see it with my parents they have very few friends now and don't do much besides working. My dad is mostly watching TV after work till he goes to bed and repeats the circle. They tell me I have to work like this as well but at the same time them talking about work is only negativ.
Even if I think about the stuff I would like to do I would never want to do it 40h a week.
Doing something this much and doing it for money sucks every passion and fulfillment out of it for me. When I think about it even getting payed for just playing video games 40h a week would feel terrible after a few month.
I know for many people money or building a career is a motivation but I don't really care about that. Enjoying to do the work I do is what I want but it seems impossible to find.
Some of my friends also see this problem and understand how helpless it makes me feel but they can't offer a solution. They say I should just start something and see how it goes but the last two times I did this it just made me feel more helpless and trapped.


I don't know where I'm going with this post, guess I just want to rant a little. Thinking about my future feels horrible like this world is not made for me and in the end I will just have to drop the stuff I like leave the friends I love being with and work a job to finance a life I don't like living.

I used to go to college in california, work 10-12 hrs a day, make a great a mount of money during the summer, live alone, have my own bills and pay them; life was getting better than the covid came through.

i now sit at home doing nothing but watching people streaming/playing video games. 

even games for me are kind of useless since I have no longer that drive to play them or find joy. 

i feel very hopeless and alone.

even before that things never went the way i thought they would(opening a business/make friends/ grow professionally).

i dont even have the drive of having my own company because nothing that i do in life goes forward.

my own family has a preconception of me that I only do drugs or have depression.

i used to be a very live and happy person, looking to help others but even then when you extend your hands they aim for your whole arm :'(

i dont know what else to do...

i do investments(bitcoin) and prefer to stay home; less chance of dying from an accident or expecting too much from something and not getting anything in return, you cant go outside because things are closed and everyone has to wear a mask = very miserable life.

im 25 years old and have 2 years left of engineering school; I have decided to stay at home and when schools get back up ill finish my degree. life isnt what i thought it was.

i know some people have worst life conditions than me but I just cant handle this suffering anymore; i used to be full of life now its all gone.

i never thought i would end up depressed but i think i have arrived at this point.

writing this makes me feel aware but at the same time nothing else motivates me in life expect take care of my dogs and see who really is a true friend.

k2quab,gdwgpl8,I popped a bunch of anti-depressants and anxiety pills on an impulse.,"I was on an anxiety related medication a year ago and had some pills leftover after the medication course was over - which I didn't think much about. Last few months, I have kept cycling between really low and high moods. And I had a low mood for the past few days; but today the dam just broke. In between the incessant crying, I don't know what came over me; I just popped in all the pills that were leftover. Thankfully, there were only about 7-8 left. That is still about 4 times the recommended dosage, but apart from some drowsiness, I am mostly fine.

The problem is that at the time when I was gulping them down I was fervently looking for more. Had there been more I may have, may have taken all of them.

I am not suicidal. At least I don't think I am. This was more of an impulse coming from a really low point. I just can't seem to catch a break and now to add to it I am terrified that slowly and steadily the last 'barriers' that I have against getting serious suicidal thoughts are slowly getting eroded.

iufu62,g5lhxk6,College depression,"I just started college. I’m from Colorado, and moved all the way out to hawaii with my girlfriend to go to a university over here. Needless to say, the dream that we had about this place in sophomore year has been fucking destroyed by covid - and with it, I feel like my mental has as well. 

I was (and truly still do try to be) a very healthy person and was on a very strong streak before I left for college. I am a kinesiology and exercise science major and I *plan* to be a physical therapist and personal trainer in the future, so I take health and exercise very seriously. Back at home, while the gym was closed I bought myself a bunch of equipment that kept me working out 7 days a week and then when the gym reopened I went back to 6 days a week. At 5’8, 145-150 lbs, I struggle with weight gain and have my whole life. I’ll talk about this later in the post. Anyways, exercise was my fucking everything. No matter what I was doing that day, I *had* to go to the gym and get my push, pull, or lower body workout in. It would destroy my mood if I didn’t. If I wasn’t there, I was with my girlfriend who is my best friend in the entire world and the only person I can confide with anything and one of three people I can feel 100% myself with. We’ve been fighting a bit lately but because we essentially are roommates (I’ve pretty much moved into her dorm; we push the beds together) we spend 24/7 with each other, so it’s a given. Me and her have been dating for almost 3 years now, and we’ve spent almost every single day of those 3 years together...I don’t regret one minute of it. Without her, I genuinely think I’d be dead.

I also had my two best friends back in Colorado. I’ve known one of them since kindergarten, and the other since like 2nd grade. We hung out regularly and it really felt good because for one, it obviously gets a little tiring to be with a girl all the time when you just want to release some testosterone, talk sports and video games, etc. Those guys are lifelong friends, and, again, without them I really believe I’d be dead. The other friends I had in high school left me for dead when I reached a .38% BAC spring break of my freshman year - so, needless to say, my 2 friends were all I had other than my girlfriend. My family has never been close to me and have always favored my older sister, so I was very close with my girlfriends very extensive family, but, again, she has two sisters, a single mother, and the majority of her family are women...I needed my 2 best friends to feel like a man, if you get what I mean. Anyways, one of my friends ended up going to Miami, and one of them went to Boulder, so, we’re 3000-6000 miles apart from each other. It fucking sucks. We still have groupchats and send memes and talk every day...but it’s not the same.

When I got here, I was expecting the absolute best. It’s hawaii. Paradise. Beaches, hikes everyday - that’s what I thought when I got here. I was very quickly proven wrong. COVID is really bad on Oahu, so we had to do a 14 day stay-on-campus quarantine. I had gone to the gym the day before I left Colorado, so I was itching to get back and not fall off my rhythm. I shipped all my supplements with me and some resistance bands, an ab rollout wheel, a yoga mat, and a couple other small things to get a workout in, but to this day, I have only used the yoga mat once. The gym was open for the last 2 days of my bubble quarantine, but I was obviously not allowed to go to it because of the quarantine rules. The only thing I was thinking of was being able to get out of the quarantine and step in the gym, feel some sense of familiarity to home. The day I got out of my quarantine, all gyms around honolulu closed. That was on September 1st. It’s been a month since I have truly worked out. I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind, and I have 0 motivation to do bodyweight workouts or use my equipment. 

Remember how I said I was going to talk about weight gain later in my post? I go to the gym because I have super fucking severe BDD. I can’t look at myself in the mirror, I’ve had literal panic attacks doing it. When I go to the bathroom, I don’t take my glasses so I can’t see myself clearly if I accidentally look in the mirror. I’ve been pretty skinny my whole life and although I know I’ve gained a lot of muscle (but, because of the BDD, I can’t really comprehend how much I actually have) I still feel like I’m a fucking twig. I’ve spent days of my life crying over this, wanting to kill myself because I think it won’t get better, and I was forcing myself in the gym to change that. People at work back home would always call me swole and stuff like that, which would always boost my mood, and my friends and girlfriend would repeat those remarks...but my brain just can’t accept it. I’m 5’8, varying from 145-150 lbs. I feel like I look like a child, and now that I’m going to the beach out here regularly, I have to take my shirt off and fucking hate having to look at myself, and realize others are looking at me. I feel so skinny. I can’t go to the gym, covid gets worse here every day and it probably won’t open anytime soon. I feel like I’m not eating enough because of the fucking god awful workload from college, and I’m avidly trying to eat. I feel like I’m losing muscle mass, I feel like I’m getting skinnier and I already felt skinny. I haven’t been happy since the day I’ve gotten here...I’ve genuinely been at the lowest point of my entire life. A kinesiology major is 5’8, probably weighs 145 lbs, and hasn’t gone to the gym in months. Oh, and I also have really bad anterior pelvic tilt, lower back pain (worked at a tire shop for two years), and really bad rounded shoulders. My upper back muscles are really developed and my lower back muscles are not, giving me a thin waist (I wear a size 29) and leading to a large curvature of my back (this condition is called kyphosis, which, I refuse to look up because I don’t want to know if I have that on top of all my other fucking problems. Online learning makes these postural connected issues so, so much worse. My upper back (scapular area) is so fucking tight all the time, my rounded shoulders are super fucking tight and if I push on them they are in agonizing pain. I don’t know what to do about all this. I’ve watched hundreds of YouTube videos and very little has helped, one routine that I do negates the other one. I can’t afford a physical therapist, or a trainer. This is what a guy who was working out 6 days a week has negated to. 

I have no friends other than my girlfriend here. I’m a pretty shy person and because of that thing I mentioned about my friends leaving me for dead, I’ve been extremely cynical of people since then. I had “work friends” at work only, but the only people I truly trusted were my girlfriend and two best friends. I don’t want to go out and make friends based on what I’ve seen of the people here, but I feel lonely. Again, if I didn’t have my girlfriend, I don’t know where I’d be.

With all of these issues, missing home, missing my friends, missing my dog, the college workload and the fact that with online school I’m essentially teaching myself, I have never been in a darker place my entire life. I’ve echoed this to my friends, who have easily made friends at their colleges and are having great times, and I’ve echoed this to my girlfriend, and they both told me to find a therapist. I’m 18. I’m a broke college student. My parents aren’t gonna pay for therapy. I’m making this because I need to get this off my chest. I don’t know what to do. I would never hurt myself, but I feel so fucking terrible every day. There’s so much more I could say...but this is what it’s been so far. I want to be home so bad. I wish I was a fucking kid again. I probably won’t come back here next semester...but how the fuck do I do this for another 3 months.","Your school might offer counseling services for students at no or very very low cost for a limited number of sessions, so those could be one option if therapy is something you're considering and cost is a barrier. This could be a helpful stop-gap to make it through the next few months, especially if you're planning to return to CO and not return to HI at the end of the semester. If that's not available, some private practice therapists might offer services at a reduced cost if cost is a barrier, or you may be able to use health insurance to significantly reduce the cost (depending on the plan).

This is such a difficult time in the world right now. It can be super hard to adjust to such a dramatic disruption of day-to-day activities as well as long-term plans, and it's absolutely OK to reach out to professionals and seek support if you need it. Therapy won't fix anything directly, but it can help you develop workable strategies to make the next few months more bearable.",0,0,0

I didn’t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.

Flash forward two years - I’m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. 

One of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - it’s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So I’ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isn’t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)

I won’t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that I’m glad I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. 

__Him:__ erm...that’s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.

__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldn’t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldn’t not have them. 

__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? I’m really uncomfortable with this topic. 

__Me:__ ok I know but that’s why I haven’t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I haven’t even brought up suicide in two years with you.

__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?

__Me:__ because you’re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said you’re 100% emotionally supportive but I can’t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?

__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.

__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so you’re one of the few people left I could talk to.

__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?

__Me:__ no I never said that, but you’re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.

__Him:__ What? So now you’re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I don’t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??

__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.

__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _I’m_ a bad partner?!

__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said “there’s nothing wrong with you you’re not depressed.”

__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! I’m not a doctor!!

__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?

__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!

__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said I’m not sad I’ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.

__Him:__ Again, I didn’t know that was a cause for concern.

__Me:__ what about now? You’ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you they’ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?

__Him:__ I don’t know. Depends on who.

__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)

__Him:__ umm probably not, Bob’s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.

__Me:__ so...you wouldn’t even recommend he talks to a doctor. What’s the harm in that?

__Him:__ I’m not a doctor, and it’s his responsibility to go see one.

__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.

__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?

__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._

__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!

__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?

__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I don’t really have those thoughts anymore.

__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???

__Me:__ because my doctor said it’s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.

__Him:__ ....

__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ ...

__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.

__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.

__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldn’t control. 

__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?

__Me:__ no.

__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then I’ll take you to the hospital.

__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?

__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.

__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.

__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. It’s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__

__Me:__ actually I’d didn’t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You don’t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think I’m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?

__Him:__ no I didn’t say that.

__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?

__Him:__ no you’re putting words in my mouth.

__Me:__ literally what you said.

__Him:__ see? This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. 

__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.

__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!

Anyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didn’t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._

__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?

__Him:__ OMG! When someone says “you can talk to me about anything” you should know to just say “ok, thanks.” You’re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said they’re uncomfortable talking about!

__Me:__ lol.

I’ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and I’m the only one who needs counselling.

Honestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasn’t conscious of and couldn’t control.

I know at the end of the day my mental health is no one else’s responsibility and it’s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But I’d ideally just like a friend or family I’m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you can’t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but it’s still nice to have someone you’re already close with be supportive of you. 

For anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you that’s not the first option. We’ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he can’t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but they’re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. 

Anyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening.",He seems to not understand,0,0,0
kun7md,givgug4,"We've had 3 deaths in the last few months, of people very close to us. Now, my fiance is in icu, he nearly died. Im struggling","I dont consent to my post being , copied, pasted, screenshot and/or reproduced in any way.

 Pretty much just the title.. a close friend a few months ago, a 10 year old girl who is the same age as my youngest, and who i cared for when her own mother was very sick. We buried her two days before Christmas..and then another close friend who suicided on Christmas day. 
Then, my fiance started to get sick...i took him to hospital when we thought it was bad enough,  they rushed him straight in and he was in icu the next day..that was 3 days ago. They have a policy due to covid, to only allow 1 visitor for 1 hour, per day. They let me stay 13 hours the first day, then 8 hours the second day. Then, yesterday..they only let me stay 1 hour. Hes unconscious most of the time so he doesnt know im not there but im finding it so hard to cope. Home is empty without him. I feel lost withiut him. I feel helpless because i can't help him. I miss him and im so worried. Im sorry that so many of you have lost your most beloved people and here i am crying about mine who still has a chance. I just didnt know where else to go.","Not sure if my reply will be helpful but I will share my experiences anyways. I’ve lost many people through my life. I’m only 22 years old. I lost my dad when I was much younger, then lost all 3 of my grandparents within a short period of time, I lost my aunt last year, Ive lost many friends, ex’s, family members. In the last year 4 of my boyfriend’s close friends have passed. Throughout all of this, I handled things very well. I had a general understanding of the way life works, and the only thing we are all promised is that we will all pass. Despite this understanding, I developed a very big fear of death. Talking about it would send me into panic attacks, I had all these rituals for the people in my life to make sure they were safe (If I heard sirens, anyone I wasn’t with I would check their locations, call, and if I didn’t get an answer, drive to their house. Throughout the night, I would check 10-15 times to make sure my boyfriend and our animals were breathing. Things like that.) I had plans in order of what needed to be done if something happened to someone I cared about. I asked my boyfriend all the time, “Who would you like our dog to stay with? Who would you like this to go to?” Doing all these things and preparing myself for something to happen made the anxiety lessen. My boyfriend died about a week ago, and no matter how much I had prepared in case something were to happen, I was not prepared. I heard the sirens, I knew he had left to the store an hour ago and should’ve been back, I sent him a text and thought, “This could be the last text I send him.” I knew all these things because I had prepared myself for this moment my whole life, for the next person to be taken away. I was still in complete shock. I didn’t get to see him, I had no idea when he was leaving to go to the store that “be safe” was the last thing I was gonna say to him. I want so badly to talk to him one more time, see him one more time, make sure he knows the way I feel and that even this could never change it. I just want him to have heard these things, that for the rest of my life I will wait to be with him again. I know that no one likes to prepare for these things, but say every single thing you need to say, make sure he hears all of it. I don’t know if mine can hear me, but I still tell him every day all the things I wish I had the chance to say.",0,2,0
lg7x52,gmrvwd5,I do not have any motivation to live anymore,"Hi (21f). Since I was a child, I remember crying and wanting to leave from this world. I would usually cry alone and write death notes that i would then destroy and i would scratch/bite or hit myself in the chest until i felt enough pain and then stopped.When school started I was pretty good at it (usually I was the 1 or second in my class) and it  kind of felt nice so I did not feel much of a failure and I rarely self harmed, but i had a lot of migraines. In middle school I was considered kind of attractive plus i was smart so people approached me and would ask me to hang out with them but  never in my life i had a real friend they would approach me because they wanted something from me, I was always that one person from the group that would learn sth last or not at all and most friends were kind of toxic. At  around 15 I started feeling this emptyness out of the blue, my mind would travel away when I was out with ""friends"" and I would costantly ask myself why am I with them and even when  I was alone or at school I would constantly fantasize about scenarios in my head with imaginary people having conversations with them,or If I was bored I would imagine myself walking out of i.e the school and just wondering around the city, basically trying to create a simulation in my head of the city and I would just walk around.       
  The empty feeling just keeped getting worse and by 17-18 I either felt like shit or felt numb.I also had ""stomach"" problems and would feel tired and had a lot of migraines .Anyway I pass some entrance exams and I got accepted to the uni of my first ""choice"", in engineering. Honestly I never knew what career path to choose and I love math and logical thinking and it seemed like an ok choice(keep in mind that from the outside it seemed like my dream. I generally always smile and I try to look put together). In my first year of uni I was hopefull because I thought that I would find my people, you know, the friends you are supposed to have. At first I was in a group of girls and I felt super happy but they turned out to be toxic.One of the girls got jealous because a guy at a night out  offered me a drink twice and I rejected.After the party she told me that she liked him and i told her that I am not intersted and I rejected him so there's not a chance that i would be with him. Strangely she got mad and then exlcuded me from the night outs with the girls and would tell me that guys approached them like it was some kind of achievement. The first time that situation happened I did not think anything of it and I was happy for her but that got her even more mad and then the girls were bullying me, telling me that I am ugly in front of people ,would ask for help at uni but never helped me out and so on until I kind of stopped hanging out with them.After that incident I decided to hang out out with some boys from our uni (keep in mind that girls-guys ratio in my uni is like 10/100 so I would get approached by a lot a of guys more often). At first it was nice until one of them confessed that he likes me even though he acted as a friend, and after that rejection he got mad and would call me an asshole and a slut to other guys of this uni(I learned that after a year from his best friend who eventually did the same thing to me, like wtf). I also joined more friend groups and eventually one of the guys would be into me I tell them in the nicest way I can that I am not interested and then the whole friend group stops hanging out with me.Anyways, at the 2nd year I felt more tired, I would have pain in a lot of body parts(joints, head, even heart ) . All that tiredness resulted in my grades dropping and even failing at some subjects. 3rd year passes and again I feel constantly tired, failed some classes and almost none social life, only some guy friend groups that were the same deal as the previous ones. Anyway then quarantine happened, my symptoms of tiredness and pain worsened I keep failing at the one thing i was good at (having good grades) and  I got diagnosed with celiac disease.Also I got some dental fillings for the first time ever from not my usual dentist and he did a crappy job and I have pain in my mouth for over a month and the other dentints I went found nothing wrong with my teeth but i am in pain. I started hitting myself in the chest again and also choke myself until I feel enough pain and get back to my senses.I just feel like i had value because I was good at sth and now I am failing and I keep having pain(teeth pain, joint pain), tiredness, i have no friends  because the ones i had pretty much approached me because they liked me physically.Also I never had a boyfriend because I am afraid of getting hurt as most guys my age just like me because of my looks/grades i had. So you know I have nothing left and the more days I live I experience new types of pain  and I have no goals, so what's the point to suffer I just want to feel peace and be pain free.","Sorry for all that happened, as a guy I will freely admit that 99% of men are nothing but a bunch of horny narcissists, stay as far away from us as you possibly can. Being perpetually tired is the story of my life, the only advice I can give is find something you really care about in life and go complete zombie mode for every other aspect of your life except that one thing. Not caring about anything at all leads to that perpetual tired-ness day in and day out that at least in my case turned into severe depression and a smoking addiction that will likely kill me in a few years. Learn from my mistakes stranger! Find that thing and hold onto it for life. Hope this helps...",2,0,0
gm9v90,fr2de4f,"I have porn-induced ED, am unsatisfied with my current GF, and feel like an asshole.","I've been watching porn since I was 12 (I'm 25 now). I'm addicted and get turned on to porn related to my combat fetish (boxing, wrestling, mma). The only long-term relationship I've really had is the one I'm in now. I've been with my girlfriend (24 years) for about 4 years. I don't even remember why I pursued her. Maybe because I just wanted a girlfriend because that was some arbitrary, social standard I tried to meet. 

We didn't have sex in the first year, we'd only kissed and made out. We tried after year 1 and I couldn't keep it up so we brushed it off. But, as we kept trying, I kept thinking about girls in porn and other girls that I know in real life just to get hard while having sex with her. We have excellent chemistry and have lots of fun together outside of sex. But, she's very clingy, has put on some weight over the years, and I generally don't find her that attractive. I feel like I love her more as a best friend than as a romantic partner. We're living together now.

She deserves better than that because she tries. She tries so hard to be there for me. She is genuinely a great person. I try to be a good boyfriend the best I can. She tells me that I was the reason she was able to stay sane while she lived long-distance every summer for the past 3 years by herself for her career and I feel proud of that. But, I know that she deserves better. She needs someone that is attracted to her as much as she is to me. I'm a piece of shit. I've told her about my masturbation addiction and that I'm not that attracted to her and it hurt her bad. But, she still wants to be together and makes things better. 

I don't know if I should end this relationship or try to salvage it. I am currently trying nofap and have not PMO'd in 3 weeks. I'm currently seeking help from a local therapist who've I only seen once and have yet to hear back from after our first appointment a week ago. This nightmare is on my mind every day. I can't escape the dread this gives me. I need help.","Hey man I’m proud of you for recognizing a big problem and responding by doing nofap. So many people on this subreddit will probably hate on it, but the benefits are indisputable. It is a f***ing war, not for the faint of heart, but you can win it. 

I haven’t pmo’ed for ~490 days so far, and it honestly changed my life massively. And it is because I chose to change, and I chose what changes to make. Nofap is one of those choices that catalyzed all the others. It sounds like you are starting the same journey. 

I hope you can replace porn with something else - even like ice cream or binging tv once in a while. If I felt awful due to the urges, I would go eat ice cream. It distracted me plus incentivized me to work out to not get fat. Also, if your gf can be an accountability partner, I think that could pay off massively - would lead to both more trust and objective improvement. 

You chose who you became, but you can also choose who you will become.",1,2,0
ka1n5c,gfa16xf,Why do I connect my self-worth with my weight?,"I’ve had weight problems my whole life. At my highest, I weighed 455lbs when I was 22 years old. By the time I was 24 I had weighed 335. Now over the course of the pandemic I have put weight back on. I now weigh 350. I know I’m gonna get my shit together and take care of it, that’s not my concern. My concern is that Christmas is coming up, and I was looking forward to eating spending the holiday in sweatpants, watching movies and eating my soon to be mother-in-laws delicious Christmas cookies. 

I won’t be able to do that. I am so afraid of judgement now that I’ve put weight back on that I won’t be able to enjoy myself. In addition to that, I feel like I’m connecting my worth as a person with my success at loosing weight. Sometimes I think people think less of me because of my weight. 

I’m not really doing the thought justice here so let me try this. I see a non-overweight person wearing comfortable clothes and relaxing with a beer or glass of wine, and I think to myself something along the lines of “you can’t do that, cause you’re not normal”","I identify with this so hard.

k5knus,geg7mh0,I’m so slow and bad at math and it’s genuinely giving me anxiety now,"**TL;DR: I’m falling behind in my statistics class, my grade has gone down an entire letter grade with one bad exam, and I’m getting that Good Old math anxiety again.**

I’m a college sophomore, currently taking an intro to statistics class. At first, I had an A in the class. I used to habe a lot of anxiety around math in high school and my first semester (when I took this class and got a D), but it went away.

As the semester has gone on, I’ve been slipping though. 

Then, I had surgery. Not planned, emergency surgery. I was out for a week or two, and ended up coming back before I was physically or mentally ready. 

Unfortunately, when I was out, things got harder. More computing, more formulas, less using programs. 

My exam for the unit I was out for was a 67%. And that’s with getting an extension *and* extended time.

I went from an A to a B. And I know a B isn’t bad, but I feel like I’m slipping further and further behind. 

What’s worse is I’m ADHD. I’m inattentive, and these multi-step equations kill me. One wrong move, one forgotten step, and I get it wrong. 

I feel so dumb! I want to go into research. But I can’t even do *basic* statistics! How am I going to do the upper-level stuff? I keep getting question after question wrong. I keep asking my professor to slow down when we’re already behind, and I can see that she’s frustrated.

I have a quiz Monday and my final exam two Saturdays from now. I have no idea what to do. I’m so anxious. I’m scared to go to my professor because she gets upset easily.

I can do all the studying in the world, but no amount of studying makes up for the fact that I miss these little things so easily.

I‘m at a loss for what to do. I get dizzy just thinking about this upcoming final.","Ask for an accommodation (eg. More time to complete exam). It sounds like the multi-step equations take a bit longer for you to digest and you’re slipping up but know your stuff. Extra time would help ease your anxiety and the time pressure. 

Wish I was smart enough to ask for that when I was in uni. Rushed thru exams, because I knew I was going to be sick just wasn’t sure when. That or threw up before exam or early on, so I could get back to focusing on the test (don’t recommend this. It’s a horrible way to start unless you believe that “it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish”. Also, didn’t make it to the washroom a couple times ��)

hejqpj,fvtkpdz,The term narcissism has been weaponized. The colloquial narrative of “narc abuse” has led to an unnecessary amount of people being labeled narcissist,"Narcissism is primarily characterized by grandiose sense of self, an excessive requirement for validation, and low empathy. It’s really important to understand that this is not an absolute. These traits lie on a continuum or spectrum, and not everyone who displays them warrants a diagnoses. A person can be very grandiose, but have a lot of empathy. Similarly, have low empathy and not exhibit an inflated sense of self. Or have a very fragile concept and need inexhaustible amounts of validation because they can’t generate it internally - but not consciously want to hurt anyone. Look at all the insta gurus. 

What looks like “narcissism” can be learned behavior, self-protective mechanisms, or disrupted development - where a child didn’t move past egocentric ( which all children are) view of the world. It is also very often a trauma  response: a constructed identify that protects a very fragile core. 

The term narcissism has been weaponized. The colloquial narrative of “narc abuse” has led to an unnecessary amount of people being labeled narcissist. There really are not that many narcissist walking around. Nor is everyone who might have a clinical diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder is a Machiavellian mastermind whose life objective is to shatter other people. It’s not okay to slap the label on narcissist on everyone who doesn’t behave in an ok way.

It makes me really sad to think everyone who receives this diagnosis will then think they must be some kind of a monster. When we use clinical nomenclature like this, we add to misinformation, we shame people with mental illness, we lower our own empathy, and significantly contribute to stigma.

ob37nt,h3lxmmb,Wish I Was Never Born,"Alright folks, not sure where else to post this, so I'm doing it here. No one gives a shit about my life story, and I have to tell someone so that they understand why I wish I was never born. I am at what feels like an all-time low. I am 22 years old, and was an extremely sheltered child. I was abused as a kid, but only had one abusive parent--the other one, my mom, is very loving and healthy. But with all the abusive drama growing up (my mom just trying to survive my awful dad, who never stopped causing her nonstop problems even after their divorce) I felt like my upbringing fell by the wayside. I was a troubled kid, with a porn addiction that started around late elementary school, though I was always sexually fucked-up as a kid (always obsessed with sex and aroused by it way before I ever hit puberty, not sure what went wrong there). I hid the weird sex obsession from my parents, but the porn addiction starting in late elementary school made everything much, much worse. I was constantly isolating myself, I was a sullen, mean kid who pretended to be nice and polite to adults, and I spent tons of time ruminating and stewing in my own negative thoughts.

The reason I said I was sheltered was because I never had to work hard or do anything difficult. Even though I was abused, with everything that was going on, I was mostly left to my own devices. I never had to do anything hard, not even regular chores. I stayed up late into the morning and deprived myself of sleep, played video games around the clock, and spent tons of time on the internet watching youtube and looking at porn. School was easy for me, and I almost never had to study to keep decent grades.

When I eventually moved out of my mom's house (at around 20 years old) I had a job, a decent amount of savings, which was good, but I'd had almost no experiences of actually doing something difficult and especially not of succeeding. I was depressed and terrified of life. When I moved out it only got worse. I completely isolated myself from friends, family and roomates. I wasn't going to college. I showed up and exhausted zombie at my work shifts and spent all my time off work playing video games and mindlessly surfing the internet and playing video games. I got more and more depressed. My room became filthy, and the idea of cleaning it filled me with paralyzing, unspeakable dread, as did the idea of getting better sleep and running basic errands.

Porn lost its' appeal. Eventually I stopped wanting to even play video games in my off time. All I wanted to do was mindlessly rewatch the same youtube videos over and over. I almost lost my job because of how often I was late to work.

Finally, in Feb of 2021, my family sent me to a PHP (partial hospitalization program--an addiction recovery center). I went for my technology and gaming addiction. I stayed there for three months, and loved it. Being off the games felt amazing, having a structured life that was enforced by staff--I know that to some people, they would hate having their freedom stripped away, but it was such a quality of life improvement for me, I loved every second of it. I felt alive in a way I hadn't ever. I finally felt like I had a chance at life.

But when I got out, I went back to the structureless life I had before. Immediatlely, having choice and no structure enforced by someone else filled me with the same dread of everyday life I felt before. I was terrified to go back to work, and relied on padding I'd gotten from short-term disability my work had given me when I went to rehab as padding to live without working for a while. With nothing to fill my days, I fell back into my internet and porn addictions. I stopped communicating with my friends. 

Now my mom and I want to try having me live at home again, and she will structure my life and teach me valuable life skills that I never learned. I will live like that for a couple of years while I mature and learn about life and do difficult things and learn how to live on my own, until I can eventually move out. It won't be easy--they expect me to work at least full-time, maybe another part-time job on top of that to save extra money. I will be paying rent and working at least one addiction recovery program pretty hardcore.

When I first heard this idea this morning, I felt terrified and hopeless. Life seems so overwhelming. I entertain suicidal thoughts, but not seriously, because I don't want to cause the awful grief my family and mom would feel if I killed myself. I just wish I had never been born so that I didn't have to endure this awful, difficult existence. Now that I have been born, I'm trapped. It's so bitter and hopeless.

I actually feel a lot better about the whole situation now that I've typed it out. I feel some hope that maybe it's possible for me to face this new life. But I just need someone to know how I've felt this morning, because the trapped, terrified feeling will return--I can guarantee it. So often, I feel paralyzing, existential dread at the idea of going to work every day, running errands, refraining from using the internet, all things I will be forced to do if I start this new life being structured for me. And worse still, I'll have to actually show up--learn life skills, work hard at jobs, work my addiction recovery programs proactively and thoroughly and honestly. That's absolutely overwhelming and terrifying. I just need someone to know why I wish I was never born. I've thought before that it would be a relief to die in a car crash or something, something that wasn't my fault, or at least something that I didn't do on purpose. That said, I've wanted to crash my car and on purpose before. I dunno how I'm going to cope with life every day, leaving my addictions behind and actively participating in life.",I don’t know if you believe in God but I’ve seen some people in my life addicted severely addicted and they’ve given it to God of course you have to discipline yourself to get rid of all that crap in your house but I would just ask God every five minutes going a day to take those feelings and thoughts away from you and to give you a comforting feeling,0,2,0
gcjff1,fpcgt6y,I [M26] just want someone to love me... Even though I have a wife [F24] that says she does.,"We got married young, almost four years ago. She told me repeatedly that she loved me and that I was the only one for her. I knew she wasn't good at cooking, so I knew I would cook. She didn't like cleaning but that was fine, I knew how to do it. We both knew we were going to be poor, but we would make it work and move on up in the world together as we were both in college. Neither of us was our firsts but that just meant that we hade something to base our experiences on. I was happy. So so so happy. Then she cheated on me. 

It was just hand stuff with one of my best friends. It was just one night. It was just because she was drunk and horny and I was passed out in the other room at the party. When we moved away it was hard, neither of us had any friends here and she was lonely. I had friends online but she was alone. 

Then she wanted to open up our marriage. I didn't want to. I said that we made a promise. She pulled up her exact vows and said she never said that I would be the only one for her. We fought and argued until I finally agreed to try and open up. 

She has since labeled our relationship as poly and has been dating another man among other conquests since the week we opened up. I have gone back and forth from wanting another partner and just wanting to be... in a relationship. Now she has been dating him for more than a year and he comes around the house and hangs out and every time I am around him I want to simultaneously kick him out and leave and move to the middle of nowhere and start over. 

I wanted it to work out, I loved her. I wanted to love her and now... I just wish I could leave. She tells me that she needs me and that she loves me but when we go to counseling together she says that she couldn't be in a monogamous relationship no matter what... but all I really want is to be... loved. For who I am. For all of me. Not a part of me and fill in the blanks with another partner. I don't know what to do and I just want to give up. 

Now I am currently at a new job as an EMT learning to be a Firefighter and I don't have the time for myself, nevermind trying to find a polypartner to help with this or to work on my relationship with her... not that I feel like I can do anything different... I just wish she could be happy with me, or at the very least I wish I could leave and she find happiness without me, regardless of how she tells me that's not possible. 

TL:DR - My wife convinced me to ""try poly"" and now I cannot stop trying without also asking for a divorce and leaving my life behind.",You need to leave her. There are better ones out there for you. You just don't know it yet.,0,0,0
lp4viy,goaf7gx,Sometimes I cry in public hoping someone will ask if I'm ok,"Over the last year I have had several total mental breakdowns due to losing my career and lifestyle to covid, losing a 6 year relationship, a traumatizing sexual assault by my former boss and several other tragedies and struggles.

Sometimes when I feel a breakdown coming I will go cry in a public area like a park, parking lots, city bench or anything where someone might see me.

I do it cause I hope someone will approach me and ask if I'm ok. I keep hoping someone will just hug me and not even say a word. I just want someone to be there for me. But noone ever has. People avoid eye contact with me and walk away or around me. It's hard to blame them, especially with covid, and expect they should know what I'm going through and that I want attention not to be left alone.

Still, it hurts to know that human beings, an intensely social animal, have created such an isolated and lonely society that none of my neighbors know me or care that I am on the brink of suicide. They don't know that if someone just stopped and asked if I was ok it would mean the world to me. It would save my life in that moment when my plan is to cry in a park and then walk to a bridge and jump.

I'm lucky to have a sister who cares. If I couldn't tell her what's happening and I had noone, not even strangers to acknowledge my existence and pain, I would already be dead. When she isn't answering I wish I could rely on my neighbors and community to do the bare minimum of acknowledging I exist and in pain.

I just want someone who doesn't know me to care.

--Final Update for anyone who is concerned:

Today I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist, I called my sister, parents and two of my best friend to explain to them the dark place I've been in and I also told work I would be taking it easy this week while I work on mental health issues. I feel motivated and alive. Thank you again to everyone who supported me in this thread.","I did this one time when trying to collect my luggage last year. I had realized my husband of 18 years didn’t want to pursue our marriage bc he couldn’t be truthful. My luggage had been lost and whilst talking to the airline person, just began to cry and told her that I was sorry and having a hard time. She was kind and understood that there were underlying things besides the fact that I didn’t have my belongings. It’s interesting to think back and look at how I was apologetic for simply crying.",0,2,0
kbzzo1,gfxg5gq,I lost my dad today,"He’d just turned 57. He was only diagnosed with cancer a month ago so it’s all happened too quickly. I’ve also found out that his youngest brother passed away today too, so I’m completely in shock and I don’t know how to process it. My family is my whole world and I just don’t know how we’re going to cope with this. I’m 28 and this is the first big loss I’ve ever faced so I’m feel very overwhelmed. I relied on my dad a lot because of my anxiety and he was always the person who’d see me through the bad times, so I’m incredibly anxious about how I’m going to cope trying to deal with my usual mental health issues alongside my grief. If anyone has any advice on how to manage things, it would be much appreciated. 

Looking through posts on here has been helping me feel like I’m not so alone in this pain, so I wanted to share my thoughts here as well. I’m sorry for everyone who has to go through this, especially during this already awful year.","Hey there, sorry for your loss, I lost my dad in September at a similar age, he was 60.  Just wanted to let you know you're not alone, and even though I wouldn't wish these feelings on anyone, it does help like you say to know that there are others that feel the way you do, you don't feel so alone.  I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since my early 20s (30 now) and I've just let it get progressively worse, I've been finding it hard to actually conquer it for a long time.  I'm going to try and use this negative and turn it into a positive and try and seek help after this year is over, because I know my dad would have wanted that.  Maybe, when you feel ready, if you think you need advice or extra help coping, maybe go and talk to your Dr about it and discuss therapy or medication if that's what you think you need, or a mix of both.  I think that's what I'm going to do and just see what they suggest.  I wish you all the best.",2,2,0
g29xde,fnkc1k5,It’s getting harder to breathe.,"It hurts. My chest either feels empty or too heavy. I have horrible anxiety on top of severe depression. I’m only 19 and i have arthritis and carpal tunnel in both hands. I have such severe pollen allergies that i can’t leave my house at all (in texas, super allergic to mold &amp; cedar &amp; oak &amp; ragweed) bc all the pollen counts are so high. I have a hard time eating and i’m sure it’s because of some sort of unchecked thing with my digestive system- i have acid reflux so laying down to sleep is hard too. I’m currently waiting out the pandemic to get my heart looked at. I really just hate being in chronic pain. 

My home situation has me dissociating half the time. I’m a full time college student with a mom who is full-time work at home (even before the corona). She has a lot of anger issues and unsolved trauma and my therapist tells me i’m currently in a situation of emotional incest. I just started reading up on that and it’s exactly what’s happening here.

I’m so busy with school that i don’t have time for much else. My grades are okay but it’s because i’m driven by a severe fear of failure. I owe that to my mom hounding me and degrading me if i ever dropped below a B. 

I only have one friend who i met in class this semester. She’s very nice but i know it’s not going to continue for much longer. It was nice while it lasted. I haven’t had a friend since high school. Not a real one, anyways. For instance, I met this one girl during my college freshman year  who i got on very well with and we went everywhere together. I spent most of my freshman year doing stuff with her. Until she ghosted me. During the school year. While we had classes together. She would blatantly ignore me in person and blocked me on everything. I never found out why. I guess i’m just that awful. 

That’s not the first time that’s happened either. I was heavily bullied throughout my life. And for the times i wasn’t, I was invisible. I had no one care about me. No one would give me a second look unless they needed something. Maybe that friend got what she needed. I don’t know. I guess i just wish people liked me. 

Honestly every waking moment is either just mediocre or so awful i want to die. I pray and hope for better things. But when the better things come, i don’t even notice bc i’m so sad. 

Writing this rn is taking all of my effort. I feel so drained of life. So drained of everything.","I'm so sorry for what you're going through. Someone so young shouldn't have to suffer depression, health issues, and social pressures all at the same time. It's too much. The only advice I can offer is to solve it one problem at a time and cut yourself some slack on the rest until you get one solved. I think I'd start with the mental health issues. You're seeing a therapist but are you also seeing a psychiatrist? Meds could definitely help. I'm a lot older than you and waited way too long to start meds. They're especially good for anxiety, which is a special hell all it's own.  Depression and anxiety are what I have, and they can take a while to solve, trying different combos of meds.

It's kind of a vicious cycle from the depression and anxiety. They make it harder to make friends. A lack of friends leads to the kinds of relationship you have with your mother. So if you can break the anxiety and depression, then concentrate on making just one real friend you won't be so reliant on your mom.  That'll free you up from that toxic relationship. Then you've got a whole stack of your issues conquered. It's not as easy as I'm making it sound, I know that. But one at a time is the only way to solve them. And each one can only be solved one step at a time. So you may as well take a step and see how it goes. I really hope it works for you, you deserve so much better than you have it.",2,2,0
fwtaml,fmrmsvp,My mom got cancer last fall and at one point threatened to kill herself and I just felt numb through that whole time period...I still feel nothing. Is this a form of trauma? I don’t understand why I feel no emotions when talking or thinking about it,"Before my mom got cancer I (F, 20) had SEVERE health anxiety and worried excessively about both her and my own health. When I heard that she had breast cancer I was home alone and had a panic attack. From that point forward I was completely numb. Even when things got bad and she was in the hospital with blood clots (and we thought the cancer had spread) I felt NOTHING. ZERO. It was like my mind was shut off. I don’t think I cried. 
My mom had many breakdowns throughout this time period and I always did my best to talk her through them but I never cried. She even told me that i needed to to prepare myself because if the cancer ever came back she said she’d kill herself. When she told me this, my whole existence went even more numb.

Her partner (and my other mom) cried a lot and asked if I was okay and I always answered with “yes ofc I’m fine I’m not worried”...when in fact I don’t even know how I felt. All I know is I was numb and even now (she’s all recovered and is okay for now) I feel NOTHING when I think about those times. Not sadness or grief or anger or even numbness. I feel NOTHING. I told my therapist this and she was like “well I don’t believe that you feel nothing..I’m sure you feel SOMETHING”

Is there something wrong with me? I mean the fact is is that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes before the surgery and there’s the possibility that the cancer could come back. But when I think about this I don’t feel anything. Is there something wrong with me? How do I talk with my therapist about this if I have no emotions to get out or anything??? What does this experience classify itself as in therapy? It it a subtype of trauma? I mean my mom is the one who suffered the illness...not me...","My father unexpectedly passed this last December just before Christmas. He and my mom lived a few states away and for various reasons I couldn’t get on a plane back home immediately. 

Know what I did that night? After I got the phone call earlier in the day that he had passed? I cried for a few minutes then computer surfed. I still tuned into a TV show I’d been excited to watch that night and my roommate told me she’d get me whatever dinner I wanted. I picked my favorite meal from a favorite restaurant. I continued talking to someone on Tinder I was excited about. I continued a sketch project I’d been working on. I felt odd but okay during all of that. I think I slept okay that night. 

It didn’t even take his memorial service about a month later to set any of it in. I enjoyed seeing family at the service. I stared at the collage of his pictures and felt a pang of sadness and then shut it down and turned back to catching up with my family. 

Shock and denial are powerful. It took until about February or so for it to start in. I still think I’m partly in shock or denial. It kind of weaves in and out. Some days I’m great. Some days are just okay sprinkled in with moments of having weird morbid realizations about his death that I can’t escape. 

There’s nothing wrong with you. My therapist has had to tell me many times there’s nothing wrong with me. Death and facing death is profoundly odd and spooky and scary and shocking. We’re in survival mode and that’s okay. We’re okay. You’re okay. You’re a good person.",1,2,2
mt76z4,guxymag,I just want someone to listen,"I know i dont deserve it. I know people aren't obligated to save me. But I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling powerless and not being in control of my life. I just want to enter a dream-like state feeling happy and euphoric and just not this emptiness i feel every fucking day.

I live in a toxic environment. With my grandparents and mom. My grandpa has sexually abused me in the past. My dad still left me even while knowing that. When I brought up the abuse to him he just told me to get over it and that its life. In other words my pain is a burden and annoyance to him and that I should stop whining for his own sake.

My mother says I use this as an excuse to treat everyone around me like shit. I have another post that explains this if anyone wants to see it. I have a codependent relationship with my mom. Depending on her mood she will coddle me and buy me whatever I want or if she is pissed/hurt she'll say the nastiest things and even threaten to kill me or encourage me to kill myself. Every fucking time I try to explain to her my point of view she thinks I'm blaming her.

I noticed throughout my life since i was 13 up until now people sympathize with me and the way my mom acts but then once they get to know me, they decide I'm the problem. I'm always the problem.

I am aware that I am a very stubborn and critical person. I take things to heart. I am literal poison and i make everyone uncomfortable. I feel guilty when people are kind to me. It feels like wow. I'm just waiting until they find out the real me. Mom told me I'm a monster and that I'm worse than any rapist or murderer because of how much pain i cause her and to everyone around me.

I get I'm not a very good person. but it still hurts. And i want it to stop hurting. I wish i could be independent and not have this anxiety in me.

I really feel like no one loves me because its not ""aw it'll be alright, we'll get you help"" no, its ""you're a fucking childish baby and attention seeker for feeling depressed"" , ""dont say anything stupid to the nurses, just say you're fine so we can go home(an actual quote from my mum while no one else was in the room)"".

jt1bxe,gc3ihmk,Start therapy today and tomorrow I have a zoom w my professor about why I'm doing poorly in her class,"I feel like shit this week. Today I'm catching up on a lot of homework and getting as far ahead as I can, which should help, but I still have to confront her tomorrow about why it looks like I've given up.

I also have a consultation with a new therapist this afternoon, someone who specializes in EMDR and can hopefully help me, but it's not the first time I've tried and I'm worried it'll be a waste if I can't be 100% honest.

I know my prof is wondering why I do so well in class and on tests but I never actually do my homework anymore. I'm one of the top scoring students on tests and I'm literally on the brink of fucking failing the class. I don't know how to explain the lack of motivation. My mind has been on everything but school. I've been struggling so much and I don't want to break down or make excuses in front of her but I don't know what else I can tell her.

I'm in my second year of college and I've taken a W in multiple classes this semester. I'm doing okay in the others but in this one (very homework heavy) I've just lost all my steam.

lhsm9t,gmzjjx4,I cheated.,"Yesterday I cheated on my girlfriend. I went over to who I thought was a friends house to hang out. My intentions going there was to really just smoke and hang out. While I was heading over, part of me felt like I should’ve just went home, because I felt a bit odd hanging out with girls despite having a girlfriend. (We typically don’t mind hanging out with the opposite sex)


So I get there, still feeling weird inside and was about to leave until my friend called me to come in (i was waiting in my car for a while). So I went and felt fine and we just started smoking and talking. We were catching up since we hadn’t seen eachother in a while (covid). After that, she comes closer (we’re sitting on opposite ends of the couch) and we start trying to clear the bong to see who can smoke more (what we’d typically do). From there, she comes even closer and starts touching my leg and pulls my pants down. At this point, I’m looking at her confused and my heart was beating extremely hard/ fast almost like having a panic attack. She then started to give me head and once she started, I immediately stopped her and after that I felt like fainting. I felt like I had to puke and started dry heaving right there. Once I got my bearings back, I told her I didn’t come over for any of that and left. 

I feel so shitty. I felt like I went into shock. I am 100% wrong in this situation for even placing myself there. I can’t believe it, and I wasn’t even attracted to her. Once she started touching me I felt repulsed, and even more so once she began giving me head. I wanted to yell. I wanted to yell at her, but it was like something was stuck in my throat. I wanted to cry right then and there. Now I just feel guilty. I blocked her on everything so far, but what I’m most worried about is moving past it. I am certain that I won’t be in a situation like this again, nor will I even think of putting myself in one similar.",That’s sexual assault no matter how you got into that situation she practically raped you.,0,0,0

hihleg,fwgnaj9,Crying packing up my apartment. Thanks COVID.,"I’ll start by acknowledging that this is the probably the most trivial of the world sentiments right now. 

There’s a huge storm here right now. I’m having a margarita and packing up my lovely 1BR, 1BA apartment. It’s got a beautiful view over a neighborhood, and the sunsets look amazing off my little Juliet balconette. I loved my hot tub and morning apartment gym sessions, and grabbing a vanilla latte from the machine in the morning. 

Why am I crying? Partially because I’ll miss it. Partially because I’m moving into a townhome with my long term SO, and quite possibly will never live alone again (which I love). Mostly because I grew so much struggling here, and packing it up is like tying a bow on something I didn’t get to celebrate finishing thanks to COVID. These are probably what would have been my graduation tears. 

I came here needing a new start more than I ever realized. I finally put my foot down after years of abuse in these walls. I was at eviction’s doorstep twice making ends meet working full time through grad school. I stayed dedicated. I maintained my grit, no matter how anxious or depressed I got. I got a handle on my panic disorder here. I learned how compassionate of a person I really am. I learned how to be in a healthy, loving relationship. I learned to trust again. I celebrated landing my dream job here. I came around to following a dream over chasing money here. I worked my ass off here. I drank alone and did the Macarena. I learned to love myself despite weight gain here. I wrote my first publication here. I engineered really creative arguments that ultimately won here. To sum it up, I learned who I really am, here in my 610 sq foot apartment that I paid way too much for. 

COVID took my law school graduation from me. I didn’t think I cared that much. But, here I am, crying because I am so proud of the woman I’ve become here. I absolutely cannot be more glad to be moving in with the most amazing man on the planet in two days as the caring, passionate, smart, dedicated, beautiful soon-to-be civil rights minded (almost- bar exam in a month) attorney that I’ve become. 

Here’s to my next chapter.","I’ve just left a difficult situation and moved out on my own for the first time. Right now, everything feels so overwhelming and I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I needed to read this today.

i4d4af,g0hknhe,Where to start?,"Hey. So as the title suggests, I kind of don't know where to start?  I've always been a lurker on these sorts of forums, never actually posted myself. But at this point - what else can I do? I'm scared...I'm alone, or at least I feel that way, and I'm falling behind. My dreams and aspirations are fading by the day, overshadowed by life's harsh reality yet here I am, wasting even more time at the expense of a little self assurance. Disclaimer: everything below is sort of me going on a tangent - an ongoing stream of thought. If you hate complaining, whining, excuses etc. feel free to skip this. 

I'm in a pretty predictable position. Just your average loser with my priorities mixed up. For some context, I'm a recent high school grad. 19(F). Still living with my parents and under a lot of recent stress because of it. My whole life I'd been this awkward, introverted, emotionally closed off mess. All of my friendships never last and have never felt truly genuine, but I guess I'm entirely to blame for this. I can smile, and laugh, and hold a decent conversation but I've never really felt heard or understood...in High School I wasted all four years chasing after a boy who wouldn't give me the time of day. All I cared about was how to get him to like me back, and now I'm presently living in the aftershock of that agenda. I applied for the same academic program, developed an eating disorder, knocked out everyday as soon as I got home from school to escape reality. It was horrible. Thinking back, I was pretty silly but I can't regret it forever. Sometimes I resign myself to the mentality that life is better alone - that no one can possibly hurt me and vice versa. Never had a best friend. Never had a boyfriend, lover, or fling. It's just been me this whole time, hoping for something more than what I have...it's funny that I normally want to be left alone, yet I'm the core of all of my problems lol. Don't take this the wrong way though! &gt;-&lt; I hold no resentment towards myself, I'm just disappointed in the person I've become. When I go out in public I feel this overbearing sense of unease. I'm not proud, and I'm not in the proper headspace to face others authentically because my current appearance and pov don't necessarily align with who I am - if that makes sense. There's a whole world out there that I have yet to experience, and there's even more people to meet, but living a sheltered life renders all of the above as a threat. I have a car, I can sort of drive, but I'm horrible and clumsy. My skills are an absolute bust in that department yet everyone seems to be doing it just fine. Whenever I'm trying to park or whatever I'm incredibly embarrassed because my ""practice"" sessions can end up getting in the way of others on the road, and there's a chance I might cause a real accident. Honestly, my anxiety has been through the roof lately because I'm this old already with no license - which is a must if you want to be independent. Anyway, I'm currently in college. Had to quit my fast food job (yeah, I know) due to the pandemic and am slaving away at home to make ends meet to save up and leave. One thing that got in the way of my ""exit plan"" here was my sudden online shopping addiction. Within the span of a few months I bought over 200 manga volumes, several funko pops etc. I mean, it does make me happy and I love collecting but I really need to slow my roll. I live in WA and rent is through the roof so I can't move out this instant - I wouldn't be able to afford it with the pay I got at my previous job so now I'm just trying to create various streams of income to keep my mind off of things...

After writing all of that and venting out my frustrations, I feel a tad better. :) Though I'm a loser, I am in fact trying my best to change. Just really wanted to say something...anything, to fill the void. Maybe I'll take this down haha - hopefully I won't be judged too harshly. \^\^; Thanks for making it this far, I know it's a lot.","Its weird when i read a random persons post like this and they explain their problems and it soumds like they are describing me and my problems, and i start to think maybe im not that weird for thinking a certain way because there are people out there who apparently feel and think just like me, and then i get sad because i know how difficult it can get and i dont want others to feel like that, even if i dont know them i think they deserve to feel better",0,2,0

I’m sorry did I miss something?? Has Covid magically just disappeared? Am I still holed up in my house for no fucking reason???

To the people commenting about mental health, I understand, and doing what is necessary for a your mental health is the right choice. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and ocd. It is a struggle to be cooped up and I get that.

mso86v,guw2rvq,I’m Tired of Hearing about “All Cops aren’t Bad Cops” when I have to coach my brother through his first “Bad Cop” experience.,"My younger brother (17) called me an hour ago (5 AM), and before I could answer with the usual “who calls someone at _ in the morning” skit, I hear him crying hysterically and after of 5-10 minutes of trying to calm him down so he can speak coherently, he tells me about his encounter with the cops that pulls up to him for being out so early.

Wasn’t even driving, just with his lady friend sitting in the car, and they begin interrogating then harassing him ranging from “what are you doing out so late” to “ is this car stolen?” To “ma’am do you know this guy” to “ma’am are you any kind of trouble?”


My older brothers and I (20) have shared our “war stories” about our encounters with cops and laughed because I guess you just get desensitized to it all after awhile but it broke my heart to hear my little brother cry to me and me having to tell him, instead of this is just a one off encounter, that “ it just comes with the territory and this likely won’t be the last time, you just have to stay calm while they go on their little power trips.”

Having to tell my brother that shouldn’t be normalized and I’m tired of hearing “well all cops aren’t bad.” Because obviously not all of them do that, but ENOUGH do to the point that it’s a societal problem. 

It’s like being an abusive relationship and meeting someone new and you flinch every time they move their hand then having someone looking at you crazy and saying “why are you flinching, he’s not like the other guy/girl you are with.” 


That may be true or it may not be, that still doesn’t invalidate your prior experiences and that “optimism” won’t stop the flinching.

Then I was bullied (pretty severely) and told I wasn’t good enough. So I changed myself to “fit in” and ended up doing things I never imagined myself doing. 

Between the ages of 18-20, I went off the rails. I overspent, had sex with way too many people (many of whom were friends and possibly still are), I ate too much, drank too much, made myself ill, dated a drug dealer...etc etc. I realise why I did everything now, it was due to trauma, self esteem and mental health issues. I am working on myself to be a better person and haven’t engaged in these activities for 5 years. 

I’m terrified of it ruining my future and I don’t want to be judged by two years of my life. I feel so much shame and guilt for the things I did. I am not that person but I just feel so dirty. 

Does anyone have any advice? I would prefer supportive comments or none at all.","Can I ask how it could still ruin your life if you’re not still doing those things?


Practicing compassion is a very difficult thing, and self compassion can be even harder. When someone does something terrible, I avoid harboring hate by remembering that every action anyone takes, is really just an attempt to ease their suffering. Unfortunately our culture almost completely ignores mental health, so many of those actions are horribly misguided and end up causing irreparable damage to others. But still, it all comes from just not wanting to hurt. It’s hard to loathe someone that’s trying to not be in pain. 

The same train of thought can be applied to yourself. You were in a lot of pain, and you tried to deal with it in the best way you knew how, with the tools you had available to you. You were trying to feel better. You just didn’t know how to feel better in healthy, productive ways.",0,2,2
nf5xkz,gyjtzin,Am I depressed?,"I think I've struggled with depression for years, but I've never let myself believe I was depressed. I've never been on medication or to a therapist, so all I have to go on is my experience. I always told myself even if I have depression it's silly to complain because there are so many people that are way more depressed then me.

Recently my depression has been way worse. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts on and off. Im a college student, and it's really hard watching my college years be taken away by this pandemic. But that's not even what hurts the most.

I've always felt very lonely. I don't know if I'm delusional, cause I have friends. Most of my friends will answer if I call or text them, but I feel like I'm always the one to initiate things. This really hurts cause it makes me think if I stopped reaching out would they even notice.

I also think I have insomnia. I haven't slept well in almost 6 months, and I always feel way worse after a bad night of sleep. I try and get outside and excessive daily, but some days I just can't find the motivation.

Idk if I'm depressed. I think I'm finally coming to the realization that I need therapy, but my insurance doesn't cover it. I also want to know why I always feel so lonely. It's almost like I have abandonment issues, but I can't for the life of me remember any traumatic experience that would have caused it.

k7zgij,geuz5ge,I changed my mind about wanting children.,"My husband and I started dating when I was 20 and he was 22. Growing up I always wanted to be a mother but by the time I hit my 20s I was in a really bad headspace with anxiety and depression basically taking over my life. As my 20s progressed and we struggled to provide for ourselves (super high cost of living area, we both work decent full time jobs), my mental health and self-esteem were extremely bad, and we had a bunch of relationship problems due to both of our mental health issues, I decided I didn't want to have children because I was ""just too messed up of a person."" He also never wanted to have children. 

We got married when we were 25 and 27. I turned 30 this year and started to feel differently about having children. I've worked really hard on my mental health and while it is still a struggle, I have achieved things I never thought I was capable of and generally just feel more secure in myself. It took everything in me to even bring this up to him because I feel so, so much guilt about changing my mind. It is really unfair to him for me to change my mind about such a huge thing, and I take full responsibility for that. I explained to him my feelings, he said he still does not want children. I 100% understand that and have no intention of trying to change someone's mind about such a thing. I'm usually one to hide my feelings so I do try to (I know it's not the greatest coping mechanism), but occasionally I will feel grief about never having children and it will put me in a sad mood/I'll cry over it. It's been a particularly bad week for me emotionally (getting my period soon) so I've been pretty upset about it quite a few days this week and despite trying to keep my sadness away from him, he saw me crying a few times. Like I said, I hate putting the negative feelings on him because it's my burden that my mind changed and he doesn't deserve to feel badly when he's the one who's felt the same way the whole time. 

Anyway, he obviously knew I was tender about it this week. We were watching some cute animal videos earlier and when a baby fox came on I jokingly said, ""Oh my God, my ovaries are exploding!"" and he pumped his fist and said, ""YESSSS!"" in relief. I got so upset that he would be so insensitive and left the room to cry, and when he found me he had NO IDEA why I was upset. Just wanted to vent because it's bothering me so much that I am so extremely sensitive to his feelings by not bringing up the idea of children often, not trying to pressure or guilt him, etc. and here he is mocking a huge point of sadness and grief for me that he knows I am stuck struggling with alone. Sorry for the novel.","If you truly changed your mind, perhaps, instead of feeling guilty about it, you should take more responsibility about your new feelings. 

I mean, I don't think that you should be feeling guilty. People change, and that's part of what makes life a beautiful experience. It hurts. Sometimes it hurts a lot. But I think we shouldn't feel really guilty about, because those things just happen. 

What I'm going to say may sound a little harsh, but I think you should take sometime to make your mind and decide if having children is what you really want. If it is, go for it, even if that means changing your life (and the person who you're sharing it with). The only unfair thing to do with your husband would be not be true to him. So be true to him and to yourself. Not following this could make you feel a lot more guilty in the future. 

PS I'm (29) not in any relationship right now, but I recently changed my mind about that too. I used to say I didn't want to have kids (what was true). But now I see and feel things differently. So again, that happens. Don't feel guilty.",0,2,0

nothing feels real. it constantly feels like im watching someone play my life in a videogame

i constantly feel on edge around my mom

i haven't had as many suicidal thoughts, but their still there

now whenever someone yells at me, i immediately after feel the need to bite my hands and hurt myself

there was three times when i skipped online classes for multiple weeks

i pushed everyone away.

i feel angry and anxious all the time.

whenever my mom brings up something stressful i just feel so mad, ive slammed doors and punched my closet.

one time my dad was annoying me by touching my feet. the first time he did it, i told him not too, but the second time i just lost control. i cant remember what i said exactly, but i yelled something along the lines of ""god your so fucking annoying to be around"". i apologized, but I still feel really bad about it

ive actually been feeling angry a lot more then usual lately. i live in a very big city, and i get mad at the other people walking around me, just for being there. just for overcrowding the sidewalk.

later today im gonna buy a metal bat and a bunch of cheap plates and smath them in an ally or something

whenever my mom is home, and i cant tell where she is, i feel the same amount of anxiety as i do playing something like FnAF 4. 

i just want to break everything.

i constantly feel like the people around me want and are going to kill me. like everyone around me has their knife and is just waiting for the right moment to do it.

and i know it sounds weird, but lately, whenever i feel sad, i like to stand in corners.

my memories been going to shit. 

ive tried meditation, but every time i do i feel so much worse then before. when i do it feels like im sitting in a hole full of knives

what do i do?","I’m so sorry to hear you’ve been dealing with this. It sounds very stressful. 

Is there any chance you can make an appointment with a mental health professional? Therapy may be a good starting point. Or you can consider going to your primary care doctor and letting them know what you are dealing with. 

I would encourage you to reach out to a professional because it sounds like you are going through a lot and dealing with a lot of emotions. If you are having dissociative episodes a lot (when you feel like life is a video game type thing) you this can be anxiety but sometimes it’s connected with other mental health issues. It would probably be best to tackle this now.",2,0,0

No.

ljcqbn,gnbu7b9,Started to crawl out of my depression. Then Corona and the lockdown hit.,"I always had a love/hate relation with school. I loved my friends, I hated class. At age 18 I fucked up completely and quit leaving without a diploma. Had a fuck it all mentality for a year and after that felt into depression and socially isolated myself for 2 years. I occasionally went out though but always longed back for my room as soon as I went out of the house. At age 21 I gradually pulled myself back up. I started school again through 'the adult education', a government school in my country that gives you the opportunity to study again whatever your age. The first half of the year was pretty shit, the second pretty good, in terms of grades. I still had anxiety towards socializing and had problems getting out of my comfortzone. At age 22 I did a follow up study that, in combination with the previous year, gave me my diploma. After that I could finally go to college and do something that I liked. Then Corona hit. I started to socialize more and more again and suddenly I went straight back to my previous situation where I saw few to no people. I graduated nonetheless and could go to college. Now I'm six months in and felt completely back in the mental state that caused this whole mess. I want to quit, look for a job and leave this whole school mess behind me. I don't have the energy anymore to get myself to school and get physically sick looking at my class hours. I don't know anyone from my class and since I couldn't motivate myself to study, my exams were just bad.

k3y92q,gfrab33,"While it's important to discuss and improve your mental health, it should not be your identity.","Hello, I want to preface this by saying that I am not trying to invalidate anyone's mental health struggles. I personally struggle with depression and anxiety so I'm not some random healthy person stumbling into the subreddit to tell you all that your mental health isn't a big deal. Just want to make that clear :)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to therapy for a few years now + take antidepressants as part of my treatment plan. I have struggled a lot in the past year, mostly due to covid and the social isolation that comes with quarantining. I am very open and always discuss my mental health concerns with my close friends and family. In addition, I was always told that I was very strong for being so open about my struggles, which in a way motivated me to share my thoughts even more frequently so that I could work them out with the people I care about.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed, however, that after years of visiting online forums and receiving support through many different outlets, my situation never really improved. What made a big difference for me recently was reciting daily positive affirmations to build my self esteem and confidence in addition to improving my posture and becoming more mindful of the way I physically carry myself at home and in public. Because of covid, we spend a lot more time alone, and as a result we have a lot more time to listen and engage with our mental chatter. The goal of my affirmations are to change this mental chatter/mental narrative from constantly thinking/worrying about the mental problems I have, to a narrative that focuses on the positive aspects of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I focused on my depression and anxiety and made it my identity in conversation with others, my symptoms became worse. I think this is because I subconsciously became aware of all of the tiny moments in my daily life that re-affirmed this identity in my mind. If I got nervous when talking to someone, I thought ""yeah, that's because I have anxiety"". If I was unmotivated to get out of bed I thought, ""yeah, that's because I have depression"". However, by consciously changing the content and quality of my thoughts, I started noticing all of the things that were good in my life, while all the bad things started to take a back seat, which was a breath of fresh air. Our thoughts shape our reality, and the mental narrative we tell ourselves can also reinforce negative, neurotic thoughts that we want to be rid of. Simple repetition of negative thoughts and phrases can make us believe that they are who we are, which is not true. You're not defined by your thoughts.

Here are some of the affirmations that have helped me most:

&amp;#x200B;

""I am worthy of love, happiness, and fulfilment

&amp;#x200B;

I forgive myself and give myself a big hug

&amp;#x200B;

I let go of the past, surrender concerns about the future, and openly receive the experience of the present moment

&amp;#x200B;

Failure is ok, no one is perfect. Loving yourself leads to improved performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Crying is healthy, it elevates mood and relieves stress. Do not be afraid to let it out.

&amp;#x200B;

My emotions are valid and I have the right to express them""

&amp;#x200B;

That's it, just wanted to share a positive change in my wellbeing that I hope may relate to some of you.! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I am not a psychiatrist, so don't take this advice as replacement for actual therapy if that's what you need. I am also not advising anyone to repress their negative thoughts and emotions, only to be mindful of them and try to develop positive ones. I'm also not saying that you shouldn't discuss your mental health with others, I'm saying that by making it the focal point of your attention, it may make you fixate on them more and prevent you from getting better.

g1novd,fngw0eb,I don't know why life is so full of constant pain,"(as a disclaimer my partner and I are both early 20's and still live at home with our folks) Everything just feels so hopeless and I don't understand why everything feels so unfair, I never ask for a reason why things happen anymore because there is none. Back in February my cat who was 15 years old had been not feeling well for a few weeks, we took him to the vet and they found a growth on his tongue and said it might not be anything bad but it could be a cancerous growth and might require operations if that were the case. A week later we took him back to the vet, and in that week leading up his overall condition worsened so much, he had been drooling because of the thing on his tongue and he stopped eating and would just lay around all the time like he had given up. I knew he was going to die, my folks offered hope of maybe an operation could help or if things were that bad he might have to be put down, and I knew at the end of that week I would be saying goodbye to him. And when we took him back on Valentine's day they said it was a cancerous growth and that to have an operation done would mean removing most of his tongue since it was so far back and he would be on a feeding tube for the rest of his life, they said his life would just be more miserable overall so the best thing would be to put him down, so that's what we did. I called my partner to come be with me when it happened and they were with me through it all and afterwards we left to spend our Valentine's day together. I miss my cat so much, and he went peacefully without pain and I'm happy that he did and he was old so I knew his time was approaching, it's been hard for me to get through but at least it's something I was preparing for and expecting and his death was peaceful and I knew he was old anyway. Yesterday everything just got so much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this past month has been stressful with social isolation and not getting to be around my partner or any of my friends and so that's it's own thing and part of why what I'm about to explain is just that much worse. I've been talking to my partner on the phone constantly during this time of crisis since we haven't been able to meet in person that much and they had been talking about how their cat has been sick for the past few days, having a hard time coughing and trying to throw up and his nose was running a lot. He was just generally in poor condition and I was hoping he would get better. Yesterday I got a phone call that will haunt me forever. My partner called me and told me that their cat had also passed away, I'll never be able to forget their screaming and crying and the shock and emptiness I felt. The way that they cried for him out of despair. I felt numb after they hung up, like my body was tingling and I was crying profusely and felt completely without hope for anything. Not even 2 months after my cat passes away, my partner's cat also passes away. And he was young. He was only 10. And he didn't go peacefully. My partner said that he couldn't stand and fell over and seemed to be suffocating on his own mucus and generally was succumbing to the sickness that he had. They told me about how they screamed at the top of their lungs for their parents because something was wrong with him. How they tried to give him CPR and to save him but they couldn't. I left my house for the first time in weeks to go be with them for an hour or 2 because I felt I needed to. Nothing about this feels fair. I keep forgetting that it's actually real. I keep having to remind myself he's really gone, he wasn't my cat but I loved him like he was my own and I'm broken right now. And I just want my partner to be okay. And because this virus has spread so much and everyone has to stay inside I can't even go be with them. My partner was right by my side for the first few days after my cat passed away to take care of me and make sure I was okay and to help me through the process. And because of what's happening right now I can't do the same for them. And it infuriates me. They have to grieve and mourn alone, and so do I. Why the fuck does any of this have to happen. Why does this virus have to come up and then control the world and what happens in it for who knows how long. Why does the world decide my partner's cat has to die young and painfully for seemingly no reason during this time where everything is already hard enough. I have no energy left. It's nearly impossible for me to hope for anything good to fucking happen because everything is so awful. My partner and I have experienced so much emotional trauma and we can't even physically be with each other right now. Nothing about this is fair or right and I know that everyone always says life isn't fair and it doesn't give you a break but I just want something to good to happen. This year has already been the worst year of my life and it's only April. I just want things to get better soon. I want to have hope about something, anything.

fyy0ga,fn2lwrp,I don’t hate my appearance. It’s not up for debate.,"Throughout my life I have been made aware that people consider me ugly. My brother was lavished with attention in our childhood and my sister was told she was pretty. I learned quickly that if people thought you were pretty, they would tell you. If I had just met a pretty person and was discussing said person with someone else, one of the first topics of conversation was always, “OMG she is so pretty right??”

Throughout my life I have been told directly that I was ugly, made fun of for my skin problems (I started getting acne at 10 years old), and been called fat numerous times. I have been ashamed of my weight since I was in single digits. This is despite the fact that I have never been overweight. 

Nobody ever complimented my appearance except for my parents, and even that was seldom. 

As I got older I became more ashamed. As a teenager, I made the mistake of asking a friend  what she thought of my appearance and watched her squirm in response. 

A few years ago, I was in a car with my friends and they started discussing their appearance and their attractiveness. I remained quiet. One friend commented that she always considered me to be pretty. The other one, though, said something like, “but your hair is really pretty.”

My hair is the only thing that people have complimented me on, and this felt like a slap in the face. I heard what she didn’t say out loud. “You’re ugly, but...”

Here’s another ‘but’ for you. 

But despite all of this, guess what? I don’t hate my appearance. I have beautiful eyes. My beauty marks are beautiful. I have a nice, strong body. So you can stop telling me I’m ugly, implicitly or explicitly. You are not going to change my mind.

iwz5ey,g64wyln,I hate being a mom.,"EDIT: my 2 year old woke up in the middle of the night while I was posting this (go figure) and I fell asleep putting her back to bed. I did not expect to wake up to so many responses, gonna work my way through the comments now. Thank you to everyone that took the time to give advice or support

I (24F) have two beautiful little girls, 2 years and one just a few months old. I love them with every fiber of my being and will protect them at all costs but I hate being a mom. 

I never wanted kids. I’ve struggled with depression for as long as I can remember and I was using drugs heavily for the few years prior to me getting pregnant. I quit cold turkey and got clean when I met my boyfriend. Then 5 months later we found out I was pregnant. I was 21 weeks pregnant, 21 weeks sober, with a person I had known for 21 weeks. I was a nervous wreck and ended up in the hospital a few times from early stress induced labor. My 2nd pregnancy was a little better, I suppose. I managed to keep myself out of the hospital until I actually went into labor. But both pregnancies were a horrible experience and I’m not sure if that plays a part in me being so unhappy now. 

My oldest is attached at the hip to me. And then my infant child.... that doesn’t need an explanation. I can’t even get a few hours to myself after putting my oldest to bed cause she wakes up looking for me. Even when I stay in bed, I don’t get a peaceful nights sleep cause of my youngest. I can’t shower alone or without jumping out a million times cause I think I hear crying. I can’t get the house clean and the mess makes me so anxious and irritated. I can’t go anywhere alone without being bugged about one or both of the kids. Before COVID, getting my nails done was the only “me” time I had and now I don’t even have that anymore. I’m still with their dad and he loves being a dad but he’s got his own issues that hinder him from putting in his 100%. But even then, my oldest only ever wants me. 

My life is literally fine. We’re not struggling with anything, we both have extremely loving and supporting families, no health conditions, no debt, but I am miserable. Every single day I think about what my life would be like if I didn’t have kids and every single day I wish I didn’t have kids. With every decision I make I have to think about them. I can’t do anything on a whim or be selfish for a minute for my own sake. I’m always being told that I’m a good mom and I’m doing such a good job raising my kids and that just piles on to the guilt I have for the way I feel. And to think I have a lifetime in front of me where I feel this way.... it kills me. I am exhausted. Mentally, physically, and emotionally I don’t know how I’m going to do this.","Girrrrrl, feel free to message me anytime. My oldest is 13 and my youngest is 1, and I love them with every fiber of my being, but often I wish I didn't have them. There are so many different reasons why, but at the end of the day my heart bursts for those little fuckers. Idk. I've decided that is just parenthood lol",0,2,0
mhf6n0,gt15t95,I pulled 2 dead kids from a car a day ago.,"I've been on a lot of really bad calls, some even worse than this one, but anything involving children just sucks.

How ignorant and selfish can a person be? It's just infuriating on so many different fronts, and leaves a lot of people trying to pick up the pieces to a puzzle that isn't even comprehensible. 

I don't really want to physically talk to anyone about it right now, but I also just want to find of form of expression in my emotions that will be received, and that's why I'm typing this here.

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.

Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.

But this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work.

j15143,g6x87ml,I'm still so angry with my first sexual encounter.,"I (19F) had my first kiss and lost my virginity in the same night to a guy called R (19M) one year ago (we were both 18). That night, I was absolutely wasted and also had accidentally hit someone's dab pen multiple times thinking it was a vape. I could barely stand up on my own. I remember I could barely talk. R had to help me walk to my dorm room where we had sex.  I ended up passing out some time during sex. I woke up naked and scared on my bed. I saw R, naked, in front of my desk and it looked like he was going to put on a condom. He never acknowledged that I passed out. I asked how many condoms we went through and he said five, which terrified me because I didn't remember using more than one (though I could be very wrong). Later on, he woke me up when I was still very drunk and half asleep and wanted to have sex again. I said yes, but I don't feel as though I really gave consent because I think I passed out again since I don't remember anything else. 

I wish I could say that's all there was, but I didn't know any better at the time since I hadn't had any experience with guys. We hooked up again three times, always when I was wasted. One time he had to sexually coerce me, despite the fact that I told him the day before that I wasn't having going to have sex with him, which he agreed to. Afterwards he told me that he was sorry since he knew I didn't want to do anything that night.

He told me that he always knew how drunk I was because he could taste alcohol when he kissed me. He also told our friends that I was lying when I said I passed out during sex.

I went to therapy because of him and other things, but I'm still so angry. I know that I was probably raped the first time and the last time. I told my mom about what happened a couple months ago and she cried, but we haven't discussed it again. None of my friends seem to want to talk about what he did to me either. I understand it's a very uncomfortable topic, but I just want to talk about it with SOMEONE. 

I know I have every right to be angry but sometimes, I feel like I'm overreacting. I did give verbal consent, but I was so drunk that I can't remember a lot from those nights.","The 100% have the right to be angry. If he had to coerce you that's almost the same thing as rape. Just because you said yes doesn't mean that you were in the proper mindset to do so. Unfortunately being under the influence doesn't just make it okay for him. And later on being drunk makes it even worse.

Im a mentally challenged kid with not much to live for.

Academics have never been my strong suit. Covid then proceeded to hit me like a bus and made it even worse. Wouldnt be surprised if i managed to fail out of highschool, no matter how hard i try to stay afloat. My teacher genuinely asked me “why do you even come to school?” a few days ago. I wanted to tell her that my poor performance was obviously not intentional, and that i have a severe learning disability, but at this point im just too fucking exhausted to fight with superiors who think they know better (even when they dont).

Socially im pretty much inept. I have one close friend. Otherwise its really hard to talk to/understand other people. Because of that it can make me seem either extremely clingy or really distant, which i *hate.* i wish i had a normal fucking social life.

 I used to be a server. It literally feels like waiting tables, but now you have to worry about doctors being dicks, patients crashing, and the fact people can take you to court for some bullshit that happened 2 years ago. All the extra bullshit and I make just about the same per hour as I did serving. 

You see so much fucked up stuff. I'll never forget this one patient on the ventilator, but was able to communicate with me through a writing board. Pt was was newly diagnosed with cancer. The family wanted to terminally extubate, literally take the patient off the breathing machine and let them die. There's no way to know if this is what the patient actually wanted. The doctor and I tried to reason with the family because the patient stood a chance at surviving, but they make the decisions since the patient couldn't. We extubated and i watched them agonally breathe for 30 minutes until they died. The family stood around the bed and watched them die with no emotion. Fucked me up. Felt like I was complicit in a murder.

Ever since covid hit I've been miserable. I'm coding a patient almost every shift. I'm almost always on the covid unit. No one lives. I watch them huff and puff on the most oxygen we can give someone without being on a ventilator, then they crash and have to be intubated, then they die weeks later. Ive only seen 4 people make it off the vent since March.

We are perpetually understaffed, we do not get covid pay, and our unit looks like shit. Meanwhile the CEO is tending to his villa in Europe. It's disgusting to me that everything comes down to money. My unit gets shit on because it isn't the hospitals money maker, our unit actually loses money because no one can pay their hospital bills. A night in the icu is an absurd amount of money and if you're on the ventilator... oh man. Meanwhile the hospital's marketing team is sending out yuppy we care about our community and our heroes facebook posts, radio commercials, whatever. Fuck off with all of it. 

The three day work week is my only salvation. On my days off I just sit at home and think about how I absolutely do not want to go back to work. This job has made me so numb and I think I need therapy.

mv0dsy,gv9gpzi,I witnessed a murder last night.,"I don’t know where else to post this; I really just need to talk about what happened last night.
I was spending the night at my boyfriend’s apartment, his bedroom is on the bottom floor with a door &amp; window leading directly to the back parking lot. As we were falling asleep (about 3am) we heard 3-4 gunshots and a man screaming: “help me, somebody please help me” over and over again. They were the most terrifying screams I’ve ever heard.
The shots were coming from the back parking lot, about 50 feet away from my boyfriend and I.
We froze, and then I got up and ran to my phone and called the police, he ducked down and peeked through the window and just kept saying “oh god oh god oh god.”

After I got off the phone with the police I looked through the window and I could see a man dragging himself across the parking lot, so close to us. I could see his face clearly.

He kept yelling “help me please.”

An ambulance came quickly but later on we found out from news reports that he died.

hbhges,fvb2gly,"I am questioning god, my life and my ability to move on after the scary, tragic death of my mother.","I (21M) witnessed something a few nights ago that I fear will be ingrained in my memory for the rest of my days on this godforsaken earth. I am on the local fire department, and got an emergency medical call for my own parents house. I must have drove 120 mph to them. When I showed up, my older sister ripped the door open and was screaming “it’s mom, she can’t breath, she’s blue”. I raced into the house and immediately started performing CPR on her. I asked my dad if she was choking, if she had just taken any medicine, and a bunch of other questions as I pumped, waiting for the EMT’s. In that moment, I was unaware of what was going on. My brain was shifted into firefighter mode, and my mother wasn’t my mother, she was just another patient. I can see her face every time I close my eyes. She’s blue, her mouth is open and her eyes are grey, bulging and looking in 2 separate directions. With every pump of CPR, I begged her to fight. My entire life with her flashed through my head. All the arguments, all the good and the bad. The hugs. The love...

Once the EMT’s showed up, they worked on her for about an hour. And was pronounced dead at 10:40pm on a Monday night. I can’t sleep, any food I eat I puke back up. I can’t think. Sometimes I pretend it just didn’t happen and that it was a nightmare. When I do that, I feel guilty for ignoring her and pretending what happened, didn’t. I am not a devout Christian by any means, but after what happened I have looked for answers in religion, in philosophy and in my family, only to bring up not answers, but more questions. Did I do the CPR right? Was there something I did not do, that caused her to die? I am staying strong. I am keeping busy around the house. I am going to be the strongest person I can possibly be for my father and my sister. I can’t talk to my father about what happened, as we are going through different things. He watched his high school sweetheart, the mother of his only children and the woman he built a life around, pass away, while I watched my mother, the woman who taught me everything I know...you know, it’s hard to describe what a mother means to a son. I’m sure you all have one and can understand what I’m trying to say. 

That night, I yelled at god. I cussed him out. I yelled to the starry night sky and called him every name in the book. I told him to take me instead. I told him when I see him I’m going to do everything in my power to kill him. My anger has changed from that, to sadness, to numbness on a constant basis. I know that I am healing, because the image of her lifeless body in my head is being replaced with the image of her laughing, and smiling. Her, arguing with my dad only to be hugging and kissing him later. Her kissing my boo boos, and watching all my little league games. I’m starting to remember the good, but that night will never be forgotten. 

If you’re reading this. I want you to tell your mother tonight that you love her. My mom was 49. The last thing I said to her was “I love you too” I think.

To anyone who’s lost their mother, I am so, so so sorry. I understand. What I would do to tell her I love her just one more time..","I'm so sorry for your loss. Please know, you're grieving in a normal way. You're going through the stages of grief. Please also know it is okay to fully feel your feelings, too.

Some things are deeply ingrained in your system that you autopilot more efficiently than if you consciously think about it. You have rights to mourn and comfort yourself and your family. You have rights to slip in and out of whatever stage of grief whenever you need to. You did everything you could.

If I believed in a God, I would say that if that God is omniscient, and knows all, there was a plan, a predestiny for everyone. If I believed in a God providing free will, I would say there's little to nothing we can do to stave off death. Either way, it wasn't your fault. You did everything you could, but the universe has entropy and that entropy that *perfect storm of randomness in every particle of the universe* took your mother. Not you, not the EMTs, maybe not even a God you might believe in.

I also know there are no words that will truly help. So I hope you are kind to yourself. Im glad you know its just different between your and your father's relationship with her. And neither of you are *less* bereaved. Whatever path you choose, even if you believe in a God just to be angry, that one day it hurts less.",2,0,0

Every job I try to get never lasts. I live through a huge depression thinking I’m never good enough for anything so I guess that’s why. When high school ended, I got burnt out with everybody thinking I was supposed to do it all and with such high standards they gave me I completely shut down. I never been the same since then. I feel as if all my friends noticed because I only talk to like 2 now. I never have any interactions with females or none of that. Honestly I just feel super lonely and like I’m not myself. Sometimes I even look at my family with confusion as to how we are even related. They are awesome but we are completely different. It was hard for me to talk to people before but corona made it worse. I haven’t left my room in weeks(maybe months I lost count) unless it’s for some weed so that I can not think about myself. When I look in the mirror I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I went from being a happy and nice person to just someone waiting for their death date. Like I said not looking for answers or anything bc I don’t see any solutions, just needed to vent","You brave for sharing bro.

ne6aki,gyesxzs,Adult loneliness sucks,"I moved away from my city during the pandemic. I was out of work and I felt like I needed to make a change fast or I would lose track of my goals. It was a good decision because less than a year in the new state I found a job and within 4 months of the new job I got promoted to a managerial position. I am now salaried with bonuses and health insurance. 
But I’m so lonely. My friends are so far away and I spend my weekends watching them go out on social media. I’m so isolated and alone.

Our adulthood is the moment were we focus on ourselves. It is supposed to be the time where we pave our own paths.

Couple of years later, horse gets diagnosed with Navicular (a condition affecting what's basically his heels, causing chronic pain, it's a degenerative condition with no cure).  He's now semi retired, I have fun on him when he's not in pain, have thankfully found shoes with padding that help (not cheap though).  He loves jumping, bless him.

I tried a couple of vets, in the end it took $1500 worth of diagnosing at a vet school with flash computers, and she then required surgery.  In this instance, I was blessed as the owner who used to race her paid for the bulk of the diagnosis ($1k) plus the surgery in November ($2.5k).  I coudn't have done it without him.

I fell in love while working with her (race horse) and when she was retired because she came up sore, I moved mountains to get her here.  I rode her regularly at work, felt so safe on her bareback or in the saddle.  Even fell off in the river, then fell off again trying to get back on, just laughed and got on with it.  I'd always cuddle her, and promise to bring her home one day, thinking it would be years.  I knew she was sore, the owner / trainer knew she was sore- but none of us knew how bad, we all thought it was just muscle stuff that would come good with a bit of time off.  Unfortunately, she wasn't showing any improvement, I bit the bullet and ordered X rays yesterday.  The vets never seen anything like it in her life and has sent it to a specialist, but long story short... She's another one that would need $3000+ worth of surgery.  I've only had her two weeks.  I don't have the funds, and it's unlikely that without the surgery she would be comfortable...  I feel cheated.  I literally go out in the evenings, walk into her yard in the dark, she walks away from her food and buries her head in my chest while I play with her mane and forelock.

So this really isn’t a big deal but it bothers me a little so I want to know what you guys think. My husbands family is going to the beach this year for the weekend in July (his grandma, sister, mom, cousins, aunts, uncle). They invited us of course but it’s $200 a person so it would be $400 for us to stay in the condo. Plus we have to pay for food etc..  well my husband and I have already planned on a beach trip for our anniversary in a couple months for the weekend. Also, my husbands parents and us are going to Tennessee in December for a family vacation (it’s our Christmas present from them) we just have to buy food etc...
Is it mean of us not to go to the beach if we are already having to pay for two other vacations this year?
We told them we can’t afford it bc that’s $400 plus food and stuff so we are the only ones in the family not going :(
I feel kinda left out but I know it’s our choice. It just sucks. And I feel like it’ll be like that every year from now on Bc my husband, our child, and I are gonna wanna have our own little vacation, you know? Also I didn’t mention there’s 14 ppl (counting us) plus 2 kids in one condo so we wouldn’t get our own room.. we would have to sleep in the living room probably.. so this might sound stingy but I don’t wanna spend $400 if we don’t get our own room.

l1tqzy,gk1i4dd,On Patient-Confidentiality About Minors,"My cousin (then 9-10) violated me (15 then) for a few days while I was sleeping 4 years ago, would he be charged with sexual assault if I or him talk to a therapist? (California) He was just a curious kid, but probably feels guilty. If I talk to my therapist about how I was violated in my sleep, or if he confessed to it with his therapist, would this crime be reported? He was 9-10 at the time (almost 14 now) and hasn't committed anything like that since, so would confidentiality still hold?","Firstly, I am so sorry. No one should be violated like that and I’m sorry that happened to you. I think it’s important that you do talk about it with a therapist but I understand your hesitation because it sounds like you don’t want anyone to be in trouble, you would just like to talk about an experience that affected you. 

As for your question, I think it depends a lot on your state. In my state (KY) things get complicated when it’s child-on-child, or two minors. I think also the time period matters here because, while absolutely NOT OKAY, it was 4 years ago so it seems like there might not be any safety risks at this time. 

I am a therapist and if a client brought this to me, I would discuss whether or not this was reportable with my supervisor. I feel like she would say that this was inappropriate behavior that should be addressed if it was recent, but because no one seems to be in active danger of it happening again (just from what I can tell), we can just talk through it without making a report. It’s all about the client’s best interest and making sure they’re safe. Generally, we don’t have to report a crime just because it’s a crime if no one is in danger. 

I think depending on the therapist they might want to engage in some safety planning to ensure this isn’t at risk of it happening again. Depending on their licenses and the reporting mandates, they may have to disclose it just because of the seriousness, but, again depending on your state, I don’t feel any type of legal action would be taken against your cousin. At most, it would just be some psychoeducation for your cousin on what made that inappropriate and ensuring you both have safe spaces to process what happened.",2,0,0

lsr8o7,gotixou,I've already survived 4 attempts. Think I can survive a 5th?,"I've been feeling bad lately even though I try to occupy my thoughts with other things. The wheels in the brain are spinning and want to start planning but I fight it.

The urge to self-injure like I did for 20 long years has resurfaced. But don't worry. I won't give in. I've been ""recovered"" for 9 years now. I'm not going to throw that away. I won't ever go back to that.

I live alone. I haven't left my home or been outside in over one year. The last time I was outside was December 28th, 2019. The seasons pass without the sun touching my skin. The only live person I've spoken to is my mother when she comes, and she's a nut job snake. The outside seems bizarre and scary to me now as I only watch through the internet.

My entire life I've felt like an outsider. Like I'm just a spectator of the world, on the outside looking in. So why not just leave? I'm getting old. The damage from childhood abuse has rendered me broken and dysfunctional. I can't be fixed.

Nothing can kill me. I did the best I could in 4 previous attempts with the tools available to me. The one time I almost got it but they brought me back. Woke up in the ICU with tubes coming out of every orifice 4 days later. How disappointing.

Eventually got tired of the planning. Tired of the lusting for death. If it didn't work after 4 tries then I just resigned myself to ride out the rest of this life in misery until the end. No plans, goals, or cares. This life is now just a waiting room until it's time to go.

It's been 6 years since my last one. Thought I was doing well. The itch has caught me again. I'm empty. I find myself getting teary in the shower or sometime else unexpectedly. There's no end to this.

Yeah, yeah, I know. I should be telling this to some therapist. ""Get help"" is all they say but they don't understand how it works. Must be nice with your cushy health insurance and transportation. ""They have free help"" they'll say. No, where I live they have 23-year-old college interns with bullshit worksheets in a dilapidated building located in one of the worst cities in the country. That's what ""free help"" looks like.

I don't even know why I wrote this. It's rambling. Just to put it somewhere I guess. I'll keep trying to avoid those feelings but I don't know if they'll become too strong. 

I'm thinking about buying a companion doll when the next stimulus check comes. She'll be my friend and lover, and a new cellmate in this prison apartment that I call home. I'll talk to her.

ht8alt,fzadmos,"My only sister committed suicide via overdose on her 21st Birthday, July 15th, while everyone was asleep.","My sister was only a couple years younger than I, her older brother. I've known her my whole life, we were very close. She was my best friend. I knew she had been struggling with depression. She had attempted to take her life before at her college dorm, when her friend talked her down over the phone. I felt almost as devastated then as I do now, waking up to my Mother say she had attempted suicide. She became a different person in the psychiatric hospital. The medications they prescribed broke her, whatever they were. She just seemed different. She confided in me that she had been sexually abused in High School over the phone while there, something she likely would have never told me - I wasn't sure how to comfort her, what to say. I felt like I was breaching her privacy since she was under the influence of whatever. Our conversations made me uncomfortable, like she was a different person. I wanted to be there for her, but I was just conflicted.

Shortly after the pandemic started, she decided to stay home with us.  She was very depressed about the 20 pounds she gained resulting from her medication, which gave serious stretch marks. She seemed very off while she was with us. She seemed more childish and goofy than her usual self. She'd constantly run around the house with either my mouse, mouepad, or phone whenever she had the chance. She'd constantly pick up Bella, one of our cats, despite the constant cries and knowing she doesn't like being held. She'd spank us, for no reason at all, constantly. Although I found this repeated behavior annoying, I tolerated it. I enjoyed hanging out with her, watching YouTube, anime and playing games together.

Before her birthday I suspected nothing. She joked about finally being able to drink alcohol as she'd be 21 soon. I couldn't have known she had no plans to do so at all, she wouldn't even give herself a chance. We had been watching a particular anime and I was taking notes on characters, locations, notable quotes, et cetera since I thought they'd be convenient lists to make given my memory - and I was doing so for the past 3 episodes we had watched last together. She wanted to watch another episode, and I had said no. She insisted, but I said we could watch another episode tomorrow on her birthday. That was the last conversation we had in her life. I later watched the episode, as the characters mourned the loss of their friends in previous episodes. I cried along with them.

I was not awake for this. I only know of this through my Mom. She was awake last night, exercising in the basement while my sister was awake there - writing something. My Mom had trouble going to sleep last night, but she said she heard the basement door slam. She assumed it was me. It was not. My Grandma had said she went down there this morning, went to the fridge. She just thought she was sleeping on the couch at the far side of the basement, as we all did later.

When I woke up early in the morning I continued to take notes on the episodes, so we could watch the next episode later in the day. Later my mom had called for her, but she didn't come up. We thought she was asleep. I didn't even think about checking on her. I listened to my online lecture. I remember noticing that there were only 3 glasses to drink from, 2 were missing. I didn't think much of it. My uncle had gotten home, took the router into his room, and dropped my sister's mousepad that he borrowed on his last visit - she had been bothered he never returned it. He was here through coincidence alone, he forgot it was her birthday. This moments before I witnessed her body.

Our Mother had initially discovered her. I heard her screaming bloody murder on the way back up. I had suspected something was wrong with my sister, couldn't have guessed what. My Aunt and I went down there, in the basement where she'd typically sleep. I saw her in a slumped sitting position, her eyelids partly shut - near lifeless gray pupils. Sitting in front of 20+ pill bottles. I looked at her arms, I had never seen such injuries, like darkened scales - a byproduct of all the meds she took. My Aunt tried to feel her heartbeat. Nothing. I had repeated to my self that she's dead, like I needed to confirm it with myself. My Aunt told me to call 911. I remember my Aunt screaming at the operator that she's dead, she's dead! The operator instructed us to try to bring her flat to her back. When we tried to move her it became painfully clear she was a stiff, limbs not budging at all. Rigor mortis. Our neighbor tried to help, told me to try to do mouth to mouth. At first I froze, but I got over it - I wanted to save her. When we tried to move her mouth to resuscitate her, her mouth was stiff too. I had initially thought there was a semblance of hope she could be saved. The reality of the situation dawned on me.  I noticed her phone blowing up with notifications from friends and family wishing her happy birthday. It felt grim, knowing what they didn't, positive wishes hitting the void. Later in the night, when I went to grab something, I noticed the 2 missing glasses on a table - water she used to down the pills. When the hopelessness of the situation became clear I looked beyond the pill bottles, at a notebook on the far side of the couch. It was her suicide note. I didn't have the heart to read it all, but from the get go she had taken them when we went to sleep that night. That she was self conscious of her weight gain/stretch marks. She was dissatisfied with her direction in life. That note was an entire page. I only read part of a fourth of it. The note she wrote while our Mom was exercising adjacent to her.

I went upstairs with the suicide note, coldly informed my freaking out Uncle what happened and what I had found. Police Officers arrived shortly afterward. Entered the basement, reiterating what we already knew - she wan't waking up. I gave them the suicide note, showed them her ID, et cetera. Extended family arrived, my Mother screamed and cried, at one point restrained by family. I made sure the cats were okay, including Ruby - the cat my sister left behind. My younger brother, 15, was told and he seemed to just take it as just a typical event, his interest in horror, YouTube, and the loss of our Grandpa years prior, whom shared a birthday with our sister, has made him desensitized to what happened. I didn't know how to feel. I felt empty, dull. My best friend was gone. It wasn't really processing. I found speaking with family and neighbors helpful in coming to grips with what happened, but I don't know how to move on. I feel as if a piece myself died with her. My family &amp; neighbors had told told me this was a choice she made, she wasn't herself,  there was nothing we could have done, and we couldn't have known, but I still felt regret. I didn't even check on her when we thought she was asleep. There could have been time, but even if I did the suicide note states otherwise. She may have been brain dead by the time I woke up that morning. I've tried to carry on with my regular activities, but I feel as if my joy has perished too. I feel like I'm in a twisted nightmare that I will never wake up from. My family keeps asking me if I'm okay. I don't think I ever will be okay. 

I'm not sure sharing this story will really help, or if there's some twisted lesson to be had here, but check in with your loved ones often. Especially if they are prescribed medications that give suicidal tendencies by doctors that apparently don't consider that risk. They may be hurting in a way that they'd rather keep to themselves and fester inside.",I’m so sorry for your loss.,2,0,0
mq32p0,gudg0b8,Covid has made me despise the u.s,"Made this throwaway account because I know thisll get backlash from antivaxxers but holy fucking shit do I hate this country now. 

The last 1-2 years that Covid has been around has made me hate whatever you these plague rats that are essentially pro Covid. Going without masks, not getting vaccines, literally lying about information and making a conspiracy just to push some bullshit narrative that they're still in charge and somehow it's the chinese's fault like I fucking hate this.

Covid-19 has brought out the absolute WORST in the u.s, it brought back all our racist tendencies, our failed education system justifying millions of full on fucking morons who know absolutely nothing about science but spew information everywhere that they either made up or found on facebook under a conspiracy theory group.

This shit is flat earth all over again, it just shows how fucking arogant and moronic the united states is, that even though we're the top in cases, the top in deaths and the top in doing absolutely nothing about it, we believe somehow we're fucking special and don't need to do anything because we can't possibly be doing something wrong.

I don't need to get into the ""politics"" about It because I don't believe it even needs to be said how unfit out politicians have been the last couple decades and ESPECIALLY NOW, not saying it didn't contribute to this (because it definitely did) but I don't want to hear the shit storm of utter morons who just follow talking heads blindly.

I find it absolutely insane how arrogant this country has become, it's like they truly believe that they're some sort of special god given gift and they don't have to follow the rules because ""fuck everyone else, I'm special"".

How in the fuck do these civilians who have never worked nor studied in a science field in their fucking lives challenge the claims of scientists that have been in this field for generations with thousands of years of study, statistic and theory... And for some reason people believe the civilians??? Like holy fucking shit.

So not only will we not do anything to help us, ""we won't even address it as an actual issue, we think we're a given gift better than everyone else, for some reason we believe lockdowns are BAD??? and we don't believe science is correct because my education was so sabotaged that I have a iq of 12. ""


last thing I'll mention, I know I didn't talk about the lockdown protests and how they're the most moronic thing in the fucking world by privileged douchebags with ego issues and a low iq, but that's pretty obvious everyone knows that. I expect a couple ""than just move"" comments, and id love too, if that isn't the most arrogant privileged statement in the world that due to your fuckups, I need to leave and that everyone can just afford to do that.

So here it is. I'm fat. And I know why I am fat.

I overeat. I live a sedintary life. I'm depressed. It's the triple whammy.

However. Today I drug the stationary bicycle outside, used it for 21 minutes on my lunch break at work (I work from home). I counted my calories. According to MFP, I have 321 calories before I hit my limit. I will go over that today, but whatever.

It's not much, but it's something. I still counted my calories. I still got off my ass and did something. I feel a little mentally better. That's already better than yesterday.

hda4ct,fvjypgn,I sent an abuser to jail today.,"This happened a couple of hours ago, I was at a super 8 out in the middle of Illinois. I'm laying trying to get another 30 minutes of sleep before I check out when I hear a woman screaming. Sounding like something out of a fucking horror movie. I jump up but can't immediately tell where it's coming from, her screams just filled the room. Then I hear a loud bang against the wall and immediately hear a child start screaming.

The woman's screams stop but the child keeps crying, at this point I'm not sure if the kid maybe fell or something which made his mom start screaming, I'll admit I hesitated a bit just thinking maybe it was something I shouldn't get involved in, then I hear the woman scream ""oh God"" and then decided to put my ear to the wall to better hear what's going on. That's when I hear a male voice saying ""this is what you wanted"" this is what you get""

I grabbed my phone and called 911, explained the situation and told them the room number. Takes a little less than ten minutes for the police to get there, the entire time I'm listening to this guy call the woman all kinds of names and telling her she deserved it, I'm just praying he doesn't hurt her.

Police get there and bang on the door, the woman runs out crying with two kids in her arms telling them that he has a knife. I'm standing in the hallway watching this happen when the lady makes eye contact with me. I seen the same damn fear and terror I used to see in my mom's eyes, it about broke me down. There's another lady in the hallway and the cops tell the abused woman to go in her room.

They go in, get the guy without much struggle, he comes out screaming ""babe! Babe! I love you! Which, again, is the same shit the bastard use to tell my mom after the cops showed up. The cops jack him up and tell him to shut up and leave her alone. 

After taking him away the cops question the lady and it turns out he'd started beating her for not having any money left, threw her against the wall, and held a knife to her throat. When it was all over she thanked me for calling and said she'd been trying to leave him for a while now. I told her it was no problem and wished her luck.

I wasn't even really supposed to be at this hotel for the weekend, just some crazy stuff happened with my job so I needed a cheap place to stay over and I was supposed to leave at 7am but woke up late and decided fuck it I'll just sleep in. I fucking despise abusers, I watched my mom go through that shit repeatedly until she finally got the strength to leave. I don't know the lady but I truly hope this gives her a way out. At the very least he'll be in jail a few months.","Thank you for helping her, OP!",0,0,0

My fever got up to 101 at one point but now it's come back down to 100 and I'm feeling better. I'm 38, always had a pretty strong immune system, and even before I got sick I was in the habit of taking a gram of vitamin C every morning (edited in later: which might help with fighting off symptoms but don't think it'll make you immune or anything).

nbkceg,gy0sbh6,I wish I could be a child genius again,"When I was a child, I was considered as a genius. I've never truly understood why, but others appreciated me by the simple fact that I existed.

Obviously, I never was a genius. Yes I play the piano at a pro level, I speak french (native language), english and some basics of japanese that I taught myself, and I have some talents in philosophy, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm not truly talented in anything. All of these (for example ""I play the piano at a pro level"") are facts that don't really mean anything about who I really am or how clever I am : I've seen plenty of people who knew plenty of things and still were extremely clueless about the world around them. And after all, when I'm in front of someone, I immediately appear stupid because I have troubles to talk (probably because of autism). How can someone both have troubles to talk and be intelligent ?

I wish I could just go back to my ""child genius"" state, and the fact that I can't really hurts me. When you never were considered exceptional, you don't really care about being exceptional. When you are considered as exceptional, you think you're exceptional. But when you were PREVIOUSLY considered as exceptional... you just don't know how much you're worth. It's like someone brought you happiness and stole it back.

nc0s2w,gy4fzwp,My cat is the biggest reason why I am sticking around,"I’ve always had anxiety and big depresso my entire life. Started on meds 3 years ago, felt stabilized. But then the pandemic struck and every thing went downhill... it was like spiralling into a dark hole. 

I was never allowed to have cats growing up, although I am a huge cat lover. My parents thought they were stinky, no-good animals. At the beginning of 2021 I felt this huge void that needed to be filled by an animal. A furry companion that would give me a purpose in life to be its care-taker. To make me interested in living again. So I adopted my cat, Pepper.

My parents were absolutely livid. It was probably the worst week of my life, they were yelling at me. Telling me I just need to “be strong” and get over my depression. I felt like a bad person because I disobeyed their house rules. But it was getting to the point where I wanted to die really bad. My meds were upped, I started taking a new pill but the sadness still kept creeping in through the cracks. 

Sometimes I think about admitting myself to a hospital but I think about how I need to be here for him. I want the best life for my boy, he’s been spoiled with so much love, toys, treats, and a tall kitty condo. Everyday I look forward to waking up to feed him or give him pets. 

Pepper might not know it, but his existence is everything to me.

Why? I have no idea. Perhaps I do. Why do I accept this? Why am I fine with this mindset? Why am I fine with being in pain?

Wow, I have finally fallen in love with this fucking demon inside me. I can't imagine my life without it, I can't imagine not thinking about killing myself every second, I can't imagine anything else. I'm going to be a shell and that's scary right?

Deep down I know these feelings will never go away. I'll have to shut them down with medication or whatever. It'll never balance out. I'm cursed to be like this. Take away my fucking meds and I'll be like this.

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I’m with my boyfriend, but when I’m by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven’t hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn’t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time. 

But my social anxiety held me back. And now I don’t know if I can live with myself.

My grandpa went into a ward after his dementia got worse, and I didn’t visit him once. The man was my entire world, and I couldn’t bare to see him like that. At first I was also preoccupied with life - I’d just started college and moved out. Then a year went past and they told me he wasn’t himself anymore. I felt like I’d already mourned him before he went to the ward since he had lost so much of himself, so I tried to tell myself I didn’t have to go since I’d just be looking at a shell of who he once was. It killed me nearly every day for five years. Every time I drove past the hospital I’d break down and contemplate going inside. But I knew it would kill me. I couldn’t see him there and have the realization he was trapped in his body. I know what he would say - “just take me out back and shoot me”. He was a strong, proud man; and if he’d had a chance before he lost his mind, he would have chosen death. Then, just last year, he finally passed away. It was a relief and also the most heartbreaking moment of my life. It wasn’t until I was at his funeral that people started telling me that he’d asked for me specifically in the beginning. He had moments of clarity where he would remember people. He asked people to help him escape for years. This fucking crushed me. I’m still dealing with the guilt. But I have to know in my heart that I did what I had to to keep my sanity. As selfish as that may seem - my grandpa would have wanted that for me. He wouldn’t have wanted me to be completely ruined and with the mental image of him like that burned into my skull forever. 

You can’t blame yourself, it doesn’t do any good for anyone. I’m sure your dad wouldn’t want you to suffer and he understands your reluctance. This happens a lot when it comes to death and sickness. We aren’t build to handle it well. Try to remember all the good memories you had with your dad and keep his spirit alive - that’s the best way you can honour him.

kfpfmq,ggala2e,She blocked me that day,"This happened way back in July. I don't exactly remember the date but lies somewhere in the end of July. So it started with me forwading memes to a girl on Instagram...This girl blocked me then. 

Alright. If you have come so far reading this, I'd love to let you know the backstory of the whole scenario. 
So it happened way back in the month of February of this year when Corona stuff was at its rise in many parts of the world. Well, it started with me trying to get in touch with one of my former classmates who used to study with me for 3 years back in high school. I remember back in the school days, I had a huge crush on her and how I tried to always make her laugh or even smile. It wasn't pleasant to make an approach to text her but I did...I did because I wanted her to know that once upon a time she meant something to me and as time went by, we both shifted routes and lost touch (we never really talked, she was just any normal classmate to me but for me she was one of the most important people to shape my school days). Later I soon started to talk to her and she sounded pleased. She often said sorry for replying late, which I always didn't like because I knew that she was a studious individual prioritizing her academics and couldn't make the time to chat with me. 

We talked for days, months until Covid-19 hit the jackpot in March and the whole world was under extreme quarantine. This is where things changed for me. I talked to her almost on a daily basis, I loved to spend time talking to her, talking about books and history. I always hated it when she left, I felt incomplete but nonetheless, she would always return which made me feel excited. By the time it was April, I started to grow my honesty with her and I told her somethings about my personal life. I did it because I trusted her. 

It all went good until July of this particular date. She told me she is taking a break out of Instagram and would soon return. Much to my surprise, I didn't see her for months :)
Until I checked her chat way back in the month of September. Her chat showed in my DM section, her profile pic changed but I couldn't access her Instagram profile. I wasn't allowed to follow her and the followers and followings or the amount of posts of the account didn't display. 

Honestly. I might act all manly and brute and like an absolute badass but this time I lost my ability to hold it in. I cried. I cried uncontrollably. I couldn't cry loudly but I still did. I pushed my face against my pillow and it soaked all my tears up whilst I was holding myself from crying loudly so that my family wouldn't notice.  It was one of the most painful experiences. To lose someone you trusted, to lose a friend and to know that the person who meant so much to you, doesn't even flinch while blocking you. 

This was the end of it. Never heard from her since then. I am never gonna. I am alright. I am not even crying anymore but I felt like I needed to tell people how painful it was for me to experience something like this. I wanted to share my sorrow with some people of this community in order to let people relate to my experiences. 

Thank you for investing your time into reading this :)
Have a nice day ahead :)
Goodbye","It hurts, I know. Getting blocked by someone you trust can be very damaging, especially if you're already slow to trust others. Unfortunately, some ppl don't see the pain or damage they cause while others simply don't care what the damage is, only paying attention to how blocking someone will benefit themselves. Either way, it's the same result; they go on with their lives and you're left with the mess of emotions &amp; questions that will most likely go unanswered. 

It seems that maybe this connection meant more to you than it did to her. Perhaps she is more social, and so she was looking at the conversations more as a way to socialize during quarantine. Maybe she even sensed that you were getting too attached so she backed away. 

Idk, however I look at it, it's not right. She should have been more responsible with your trust. You didn't deserve to be blocked, but then again, we don't always get what we deserve.",0,0,0

jiq8ca,ga7y5qv,I don’t want to give my cat medicine the rest of its life,"And I am probably going to put it to sleep. I have a cat that’s 2 years old and having seizures. I’m not gonna make this long, but the most likely outcome is that the recommended treatment will be medication twice a day for life. Even missing once apparently is an issue. In addition to knowing how difficult it will be to administer to this cat (she is extremely skittish, runs away and hides if anyone so much as walks past her). I had to give her parasite medicine when
She was a kitten and also antibiotics for
Tooth work and it was really hard.  If this comes to pass taking a vacation (if covid ever ends) will be that much harder because I have to arrange someone who can also give medicine. 

This isn’t what I want out of pet ownership. And please don’t misunderstand, I love her and I and take great care of her and all the many other animals I’ve ever owned.  But medicine twice a day for 10-15 years potentially, I don’t think that’s what’s best for me and my family. I’m very bummed out about the whole thing.","That’s okay, not what you signed up for. That said, put some things on your local sites and maybe will take it. Don’t give up on the cat.  All the best!",1,0,0
i9pc3a,g1gphpf,I never learn my lesson. I just want to end things,"I'm in my mid 30s and the last five years have been the worst of my life. As of now I am at the worst physically and mentally. I have gained 100 lbs again, for the third time in the last 5 years and this time I dont think I have the strength to do it anymore. I have no desire to do anything. All i do is cry, dwell in the past and think what should have been. I feel like such a disappointment.

After regaining the second time, I had suicidal thoughts but I seeked help going on medication and therapy. But I didnt learn anything from it because I keep making the same mistakes over and over again and its exhausting and just want to give up. I currently have these thoughts again and not sure how serious I am but did take steps to doing it. This was 4 days ago. I still have these thoughts. 

During this time, I have lost so many friends and potential relationships and lost all credibility and integrity at work because all I do is make empty promises, lie, manipulate people. I'm completely selfish now. I have no confidence in myself. I was never like this before. And now, I dont know if I'm just a bad person or it's my depression that is causing me to do all this.","My only solution was exercise, after graduating college (difficult masters program) I was 227 and feeling lousy and depressed. I got a job as a certified nurse assistant and the weight fell off. I did squats on my days off. Helps for lifting human bodies and ended up in a lot better shape. 157 lbs at 5% body fat. I was on top of the world, getting paid and getting laid. Really helped my mood. Exercise is like witchcraft when it comes to mood. At first, I would justify moving forward because I thought I deserved the pain. But the afterglow caught up with me and I knew I had done something good.",0,2,0
mr3xt1,gulno6p,Life is pointless,"I see no point in life. I work, eat, sleep, play, study, work, etc. every day. Why? For what reason do I continue forward? What do I get for doing this? Happiness? What a joke. To what end does anyone walk forward? Is there even a purpose to doing so? I doubt it. Why should I keep walking forward in life when I will die anyways. What will I have done in my life? Nothing. It matters not what I achieve. I won’t be here to see it very long, if at all. When I’m dead, what purpose does it serve for me to do anything? Is there even a reason for existing at all? Heaven? God? Hell? Whatever. I find no reason to like anything religious. I never exactly asked to be brought into the world by some omnipotent deity. If that bs even is true, I have even less of a reason to love some supposedly all loving god that is nothing but goodness. I mean seriously, look at the world and how disgusting it is. Everyone complains about it and proceeds to contribute to the problem. All in all, life is pointless. Death makes all things valueless. Existence is meaningless. Effort is fruitless. Goodbye.",This is exactly how I feel too,0,2,0
fr29dg,fltdj1d,What's happening to me and my body?,"Since yesterday I haven't felt normal for more than a few minutes at a time. I feel like how you feel after having a bad trip on lsd. I feel like my chest is closing up and it hurts. Well doesn't hurt to breathe but it hurts like its closing up. I feel like I'm observing it all through a 3rd person's view. I was afraid maybe it's a heart attack but ruled that out since I would've been dead alrady. Was feeling dizzy for a few days and then diaherea started and now this whole thing where I feel like I'm having a panic attack combined with a feeling of derealization. 

Tldr: feeling weird since the last 2 days... feelings of despair, anxiety seem to be taking over my body.",Sounds like you’re dissociating. I do this frequently. Also maybe coupled with some anxiety.,0,2,0

gjaa61,fqjnu9w,Jobless breaking point,"As you all know, this pandemic sucks. A lot. I’m graduating my senior year and have college plans next semester that could easily be cancelled. I’ve always been a very social person and my depression flares when I feel I am alone. Since school has ended and I’m less busy, I’m having too much time to overthink. My parents are very worried about the virus and I am only going to share how their views affect my depression, not whether I agree or disagree with them. It simply doesn’t matter what I think, as it’s a “my house my rules” situation and I cannot finance college by myself. Because of the virus, I cannot see any friends or family besides them even in a mask and I cannot go anywhere public. No grocery store, no gas station, no public park. Nothing. I know that if I got a job throughout the summer I’d see people and return to some sense of normalcy, but my parents won’t even let me interview for a job. It frustrates me because my mom goes to work (granted, only with 1-2 co workers) without a mask multiple times a week and my dad said if his company wanted him back traveling he would go immediately. Yet when I mention wanting a job they tell me that by leaving the house I’m bringing the virus home to kill my dad (he isn’t old just smokes too much). I think this is kinda extreme for the situation but it makes me feel too guilty to dare disobeying their order to stay put. Any advice or kind words would be so appreciated 
TLDR; depressed because parents won’t let me work or leave the house ever and I feel unproductive and yucky","Having over controlling/protective parents has been one of the hardest factors in my life. I’m a soon to be graduating senior as well and not being able to see or talk to any of my friends has made this lockdown a nightmare. All I got is to try to hang in there and find small hobbies if you have stuff around the house. I’m not doing much better tbh but it’s all gotta end sometime, right?",0,2,0
i1szdi,g01btps,The abuse of essential workers needs to stop.,"I have dealt with a lot of insanity since this pandemic started, but I think yesterday took the cake.

I’m a 23 year old female. I work at a grocery store. Yesterday, a man refused to wear a mask because he has asthma. I told him I would not ring up his groceries until he put it on. He did, but not without raising his voice at me and telling me he had already called his lawyer and we were all being sued.

Then, at closing time, a woman was wearing her mask around her neck. I asked her (very nicely, seriously) to please pull it up when she comes through the line. She nodded and pulled it up. When I got off, she drove by me in the parking lot screaming “fuck you!” over and over. Then she pulled up next to me at a red light and screamed more. I *highly* regret not taking a video of her. That’s really the only thing about that interaction that’s bothering me. That I didn’t get her face on video. 

I am just trying to do my job and not bring this virus home with me. I’m just trying to ring up your groceries and protect myself and my family. I can not believe America’s response to this virus. I’ve seen so much ugly, and it’s so disheartening.","I work at a doctors office and have to ask patients to “Please put your mask OVER your nose”, and “Yes, you do have to keep your mask on in the room while you wait for the doctor.”",0,2,0
